(A) Purified preparations of neutrophils or platelets were biotinylated and lysed. Cell lysates were incubated with P-selectinIgG (P-sel-IgG) chimera or anti<b>PSGL-1</b> (PSL-275). Specifically bound proteins were eluted and separated on 7.5% SDS gel under nonreduced conditions. (B) <b>PSGL-1</b> was immunopurifed from neutrophil and platelet lysates. SDS-eluted proteins were analyzed on 7.5% SDS gel. The blotted proteins were detected with P-selectinIgG and HRP-conjugated antihuman IgG. (C) Biotinylated platelets were lysed and subjected to affinity isolation with P-selectinIgG (P-sel-IgG). The high molecular weight complex (*) seen in the nonreduced (NR) sample likely represents a disulfide-bonded multimer formed during platelet lysis through exposure of free sulfhydryl from the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of <b>PSGL-1</b>. Note that the major species observed in the reduced lane (R) is of the expected size 120 kD for <b>PSGL-1</b> monomer (arrow). The numbers on the side indicate migration of marker proteins in kD.

(A) Shown is the relationship between bondforce and probability of BOND DISSOCIATION for each of the three LIGAND pairs within the CONTACT ZONE. The effects of shear on the ligand-ligand bonds that form at the rear of the leukocyte are simulated using bondforce. BONDS within the rear row of the CONTACT ZONE experience a bondforce that is calculated by dividing the RearForce, a unitless parameter representing the effects of shear, by the total number of BONDS within the rear row. During a simulation cycle, each MEMBRANE UNIT in the rear row uses the current value of bondforce and the graphed relationship to calculate a probability that each BOND will be broken during that cycle. All BONDS elsewhere within the CONTACT ZONE experience a bondforce value of 0. UNSTRESSED (bondforce value of 0) DISSOCIATION probabilities for <b>PSGL1</b>/PSELECTIN, LOW-AFFINITY VLA4/VCAM1, and HIGH-AFFINITY VLA4/VCAM1 were chosen to be 0.14, 0.16, and 0.0035, respectively. (B) The in vitro force dependence of dissociation rates for P-selectin/<b>PSGL-1</b> bonds (as reported in [15]) and the high affinity VLA-4/VCAM-1 bonds (as reported in [29]) are plotted for comparison to the analogue relationships in A. The plotted values were taken from the fitted in vitro data: see Methods for details. The relationships in A are analogues of these experimentally determined relationships and are not meant to either match or fit that data. The dissociation rates of the <b>PSGL-1</b>/P-selectin bonds as a function of force were determined by experiments using <b>PSGL-1</b>-coated microbeads rolling on a P-selectin substrate in a parallel plate flow chamber [15]. The dissociation rates for the VLA-4/VCAM-1 complex, described in Methods, were calculated from data obtained using single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy [29]. The force dependence of dissociation rates for low affinity VLA-4/VCAM-1 data was not reported. We assumed that it is similar to <b>PSGL-1</b>/P-selectin relationship in A.

(A) The rolling motions of a microsphere or neutrophil of radius r are governed by the balance of the resultant force (Fs) and torque (Ts) exerted by the flowing fluid, the tether force (Ft) applied through L-selectin<b>PSGL-1</b> bonds, and the contact force (Fc). The conversion of wall shear stress to Ft using the indicated variables is described in Materials and methods. Elevating the viscosity by addition of 6% Ficoll increases shear stress by 2.6-fold and therefore increases Ft on a sphere of constant size, as illustrated by the comparative lengths of the thin and thick vectors for Ft on the small sphere. At the same shear stress, Ft is ninefold greater for a sphere of 3-m radius than for a sphere of 1-m radius, as illustrated by the comparative lengths of the thin vectors for Ft on the large and small spheres. (B) A rolling sphere stops when the adhesive bond sustains the full load required to balance the maximum Ft and Ts. After the bond dissociates, the sphere accelerates as it pivots on a newly formed bond upstream and then decelerates as force develops in the bond. The sphere stops again if the new bond has sufficient strength to withstand the full load and lives long enough to survive loading, or it accelerates if the bond dissociates prematurely.

SCARB2 delivers -GC from the ER to the lysosomes under physiological conditions. SCARB2 is abundant in the lysosomal and endosomal compartments, and it also shuttles to the plasma membrane where it encounters EV71. After binding the virus on the cell surface, the virusreceptor complex is internalized via the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. In the endosome or lysosome, where the pH is low, the virus initiates a conformational change that leads to uncoating. <b>PSGL-1</b> can bind EV71 and internalize via caveolin-mediated endocytosis, but <b>PSGL-1</b> cannot initiate uncoating. Anx2, heparan sulfate, and sialylated glycans can also bind EV71. However, the mechanism of internalization and uncoating is unknown. They may deliver EV71 to SCARB2 or they may establish infections via their own mechanisms. -GC, -glucocerebrosidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

(A) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit neutrophils extravasation, chemotaxis and activation. Neutrophil rolling is modulated by staphylococcal superantigen-like 5 (SSL5) that binds <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b>-1 (<b>PSGL-1</b>), blocking its interaction with P-selectin. The adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium and consequent transmigration is inhibited by extracellular adherence protein (Eap), which binds to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). In addition to inhibiting <b>PSGL-1</b>, SSL5 inhibits neutrophil responses to chemokines and to anaphylatoxins, by binding to different chemokine receptors. Several staphylococcal molecules impair neutrophil chemotaxis and important co-signaling events during migration and phagocytosis: chemotaxis-inhibitor protein of S. aureus (CHIPS) binds and inhibits formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and C5a receptor (C5aR); formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitor (FLIPr)-like inhibit FPR1; FLIPr and FLIPr-like inhibit FPR2; staphopain (ScpA) cleaves Chemokine (CXC Motif) Receptor 2 (CXCR2); staphylococcal SSL3 inhibits toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated signaling, the bicomponent leukocidins Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), gamma-hemolysin (Hlg) ABC, leukocidin (Luk) FM, Luk GH/AB, and Luk DE interact with chemoattractant receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Both Hla and Luk GH/AB induce cell lysis by binding ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) and CD11b, respectively. The cytolytic peptides phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) have an amphipathic alpha-helical region that likely contributes to their lytic activity, presumably by membrane insertion and pore formation. (B) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit opsonization and phagocytosis by neutrophils. The secreted metalloprotease aureolysin inhibits phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils by cleaving C3. Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN), SCIN-B, and SCIN-C associate with and inhibits C3 convertase, thereby preventing the production of C3a, C3b, and further C5a and consequently interfering with complement activation. The extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (EFB) and the extracellular complement-binding protein (ECB) also inhibit complement activation by inactivating C5 convertase and staphylococcal SSL7 targets C5. Staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin (SBI) affect both the function of complement and immunoglobulin binding, blocking the classical complement activation pathway, and associates with C3 inhibiting the alternative pathway. Staphylokinase (SAK) forms enzymatically active complexes with C3b blocking complement activation. Staphylococcal SSL10 binds IgG, affecting Fc receptor (FcR) recognition and complement activation.

After 1 h, plates were washed, bound cells were lysed with Triton-X100 buffer and bound cells were quantified using an excitation of 494 nm and emission of 517 nm. GM-1111 inhibits <b>PSGL-1</b> attachment to P-selectin with an IC50 of 25 nM. B. SAGEs inhibit HLE. HLE (100 nM) was incubated with GM-1111 at 1100 nm concentrations in 0.5 M HEPES buffer for 15 min. Following incubation, the elastase substrate, Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-pNA was added to the reaction mixture to the final concentration of 0.3 mM. Absorbance due to p-NA hydrolysis was monitored for 15 min at absorbance of 405 nm. GM-1111 inhibits HLE with an IC50 of 45 nM. CE. SAGEs inhibit interaction of the AGE product CML-BSA, the calgranulin S100b and the alarmin HMGB-1 with RAGE. Microwell plates coated with CML-BSA (C), S100b calgranulin (D) or HMGB-1 (E) were incubated with RAGE-Fc chimera with or without GM-1111 for 2 h. Plates were washed, incubated with anti-RAGE antibody, incubated for 1 h, washed again four times and incubated with horse-radish peroxidase conjugated secondary for 1 h. A colorimetric reaction was produced by addition of tetramethyl benzidine chromogen (TMB) and quantified by absorbance at 450 nm. GM-1111 inhibits interaction of RAGE with CM-BSA, S100b and HMGB-1 with IC50 values of 413, 275 and 80 nM, respectively. F. SAGEs inhibit function of RAGE as an adhesion ligand. Inhibition of Mac-1-dependent ligation of RAGE by U937 cells was studied as in A, but using microwells coated with RAGE. GM-1111 inhibits Mac-1 attachment to RAGE with an IC50 of 7.6 nM.

The positions of VP1, VP2, and VP3 that form a single protomer are indicated in relation to the twofold, threefold, and fivefold axes of symmetry of the particle. The positions of the defined site1-3 are indicated by blue dashed lines.

(A) During the course of tissue inflammation, adhesive interactions between leukocytes and the endothelium include: (i) The initial rolling, which is the loose contact of the leukocyte with the endothelium, predominantly mediated by the binding of leukocyte <b>PSGL-1</b> to endothelial P- and E-selectins, and (ii) The firm adhesion of leukocytes on the endothelium, which is mediated by interactions of 2-integrins such as Mac-1 and LFA-1 with the endothelial counter-receptors of the ICAM family, as well as the by the interaction of the (31-integrin VLA-4 to endothelial VCAM-1. (B) Leukocyte recruitment can also be promoted by endothelial-adherent platelets. In this scenario, platelets can serve as a bridge between leukocytes and the endothelium. The leukocyte-platelet interaction can be mediated by leukocyte <b>PSGL-1</b> binding to P-Selectin expressed on platelets, as well as by the binding of 2-integrin Mac-1 to its multiple ligands/counter-receptors on platelets such as GPIb, GPIIb/IIIa-bound fibrinogen or JAM-C.

Platelet adhesion to an injury site at a vessel wall is mediated by the exposure and binding of subendothelial matrix proteins (e.g. collagen, VWF, fibrinogen, and fibronectin) to glycoprotein (GP) receptors on the platelet surface. VWF binding to the GPIb-IX-V complex, collagen binding to platelet GPVI and integrin 21 receptors trigger a signal transduction process resulting in the local release of platelet activation agonists, such as thromboxane A2 and ADP. These agonists along with thrombin produced from coagulation cascades and activated platelets, bind to platelet surface bound G-coupled receptors inducing further platelet activation. Activation of platelet integrin IIb3 induces platelet aggregation mediated by fibrinogen/VWF or the yet undetermined X ligands. Leukocyte-platelet adhesion can be driven by the interaction between platelet surface P-selectin and its counter-receptor <b>PSGL-1</b> situated upon the leukocyte surface. Inhibition of platelet activation is mainly mediated by the PDE/PDE3 regulated degradation and PGI2, NO and GLP-1R regulated activation of cGMP or cAMP. Direct and indirect antithrombotic therapeutics are tabulated in the light colored boxes within the figure. The actions of antithrombotic therapies are depicted using red arrows, and some indirect antithrombotic agents (such as anti-atherosclerotic agents) are represented with purple arrows.

326	PMC3792444	/imgs/512/187/3792444/PMC3792444_fimmu-04-00311-g001.png	F1	Induction of migratory heterogeneity during priming. MR phenotype is impacted by TCR engagement, the level of co-stimulation, and the cytokine milieu (left). MR play a direct role in the formation of the immunological synapse, but TCR signaling subsequently impacts MR expression [panel 1, adapted from Ref. (8)]. Cytoskeletal rearrangements that involve the actin-binding ezrin (ezr), radixin, and moesin (mo) proteins are necessary for TCR signaling complex polarization. The integrin LFA-1 forms a ring surrounding the cSMAC that supports prolonged T cell-DC engagement, while other MR become excluded from the cSMAC. This process is possibly due to differential polarization of ezrin and moesin. Co-stimulatory signaling through molecules also contributes to the migratory heterogeneity of T cells (panel 2). For example, CD28 controls migration through upregulation of OX40, which is instrumental for CXCR5 expression and T cell localization to germinal centers (GC). In addition CD28/TCR signaling activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, which inhibits Foxo1 leading to decreased KLF2 expression. Differential co-stimulation can impact the levels of CD62L, CCR7, and S1P1 and thereby regulate the egress of T cells into the circulation. Cytokines released by DC promote specific transcriptional profiles that introduce further MR heterogeneity (panel 3). DC-derived IL-12 induces expression of the transcription factor T-bet and determines a CD4+ Th1 or CD8+ effector transcriptional program that results in part in the expression of CXCR3 and <b>PSGL-1</b>, which contribute to homing to peripheral sites. Alternatively, induction of the Tfh-associated transcription factor Bcl6 by IL-6 and IL-21 results in the downregulation of <b>PSGL-1</b> and increased expression of CXCR5, which allows these cells to migrate from the T cell zones in the paracortex into GC.
327	PMC3792444	/imgs/512/187/3792444/PMC3792444_fimmu-04-00311-g002.png	F2	Induction of tissue-specific MR profile. Expression of distinct MR combinations results in tissue-specific migration. T cells that are primed in gut-associated lymphoid tissues preferentially express functional <b>PSGL-1</b>, 47, and CCR9, which support migration through the post capillary venules of the small intestine to enter the lamina propria and intraepithelial compartment (panel 1). CD103-expressing DC impart the intestinal homing signature on T cells during priming by expression of retinoic acid (RA) in response to microbiota-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. A different program of MR usage is induced during priming of nave T cells in skin-draining LN (panel 2). T cells in the skin express the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), an inducible carbohydrate modification of <b>PSGL-1</b>, CCR4, CCR8, CCR10, 41, and LFA-1, which mitigates their migration into the skin. Analogous to intestinal imprinting, CCR10, but not CCR4, expression is regulated by skin-draining DCs that synthesize the vitamin D3 metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses 47 and CCR9 expression and RA inhibits CCR4 and CCR10 expression. In addition, CCR8 expression is imprinted by epidermal keratinocytes, although the skin-specific factors that induce CCR8 remain unknown. Evidence for imprinting of T cells in the lung is limited, but recent evidence suggests that lung DC-activated T cell migrate more efficiently into the lung, which was attributed to CCR4, although other MR are likely to contribute (panel 3). Many lymphocytes in the lung express high levels of 41, 11, and LFA-1 and CD8+ T cells primed in the mediastinal LN are enriched for CCR5 and CXCR3 expression, suggesting a pulmonary profile driven by distinct molecular mechanisms.

(A) Inside-out signalling of 2-integrins induces the shift of the bent conformation with low ligand binding affinity to the extended conformation with intermediate ligand binding affinity and the induction of the open extended conformation with high ligand binding affinity. Signalling is initiated by <b>PSGL-1</b> upon rolling of neutrophils on E-selectin resulting in the induction of the extended conformation of LFA-1 with intermediate ligand binding affinity that allows slow leucocyte rolling on ICAM-1. During slow leucocyte rolling, neutrophils sense the chemokines presented by the inflamed endothelium via their GPCRs (not shown) which induce signalling events mediating the shift towards the open extended conformation of LFA-1 with high ligand binding affinity and thereby enabling induction of firm arrest. (B) Outside-in signalling of 2-integrins is initiated upon ligand binding by clusters of high affinity integrins and controls 2-integrin-mediated post-adhesion steps including adhesion strenghening, spreading, and intraluminal crawling by fine-tuning the actin cytoskeleton of the migrating neutrophil.

[3] observed that when the flow chamber surface is coated with P-selectin and VCAM-1 co-immobilized with GRO- chemokines, monocyte arrest occurred within a few seconds. The data graphed is from an in silico experiment that simulated that protocol and is for an individual LEUKOCYTE that transitioned from ROLLING to FIRM ADHESION (Table 5, part III). (A) Dark line: total number of BONDS formed within the CONTACT ZONE between LEUKOCYTE MEMBRANE and SURFACE. Light gray line: number of high affinity VLA4-VCAM1 BONDS formed: these results show that ADHESION is mediated primarily by the high affinity VLA4-VCAM1 BONDS. (B) DISTANCE-TIME plot and (C) VELOCITY-TIME plot: they show that the LEUKOCYTE rolled for less than a few simulated seconds before firmly adhering to the SURFACE, consistent with leukocyte adhesions observed in vitro. (D) For the same experiment, the number of low affinity VLA4-VCAM1 BONDS and PSELECTIN-<b>PSGL1</b> BONDS are small and so are plotted here at a smaller scale. Dotted trace: number of low affinity VLA4-VCAM1 BONDS. Lower solid gray trace: number of BONDS formed between PSELECTIN and <b>PSGL1</b>. The black trace is a separate plot of the total number of BONDS formed at each time in the rear row of this CONTACT ZONE; these data show that for the ISWBC, the LOW AFFINITY VLA4/VCAM1 AND PSELECTIN/<b>PSGL1</b> BONDS play only a minor role in supporting ADHESION. Arrows indicate when a LEUKOCYTE MEMBRANE SPREADING event occurred.

Pselectin initially tethers activated platelets to granulocytes via binding to <b>PSGL1</b>. This interaction leads to an intracellular signaling cascade that activates and increases the expression of CR3 on granulocytes. CR3 binds multiple ligands on platelets including GPIIb/IIIa through a fibrinogen bridge, GP1b directly and via a HMWK bridge, ICAM2, and JAM3. CD40L and TREM1L, expressed on activated platelets, enhance granulocyte functions via binding to their granulocyte counterreceptors, CD40 and TREM1, respectively

Inflammatory monocytes are characterized by higher expression levels in <b>PSGL-1</b>, CCR1 and CCR2. Therefore these molecules were proposed to be essential for recruitment of this monocyte subset. In contrast, CCR5 and CX3CR1 seem to be of major importance for extravasation of resident monocytes. Inflammatory monocytes will differentiate to macrophages, which take up oxLDL forming foam cells. These cells are critically involved in atheroprogression by releasing cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-6), chemokines (e.g. MCP-1), proteases (e.g. MMPs), and lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes). Resident monocytes on the other hand may acquire DC-markers such as CD11c. Hyperlipidaemia skews monocyte counts and function in several ways (in red). Monocytosis of inflammatory monocytes may be due to reduced conversion to resident monocytes or enhanced mobilisation from the bone marrow, some of which may be due to higher levels of circulating MCP-1. Furthermore, CCR2, <b>PSGL-1</b>, and CD11b on inflammatory monocytes is enhanced by hyperlipidaemia. The emigrated monocyte will retain in the vessel wall due to decrease of CCR2 and increase in CX3CR1.

Association kinetics were governed by (1) or (2). Catch-slip parameters regressed from Marshall et al. [5],[32] were used in the catch-slip model, (4), or the just the high-impedance pathway parameters were entered into the slip model, (3). (A) The long-skip distance calculated from the two-parameter Poisson regression at a variety of ligand concentrations. Black circles: the catch-slip model was assumed with contact patch confinement. Blue triangles: the catch-slip model was assumed with molecular area confinement. Red squares: the slip model was assumed with contact patch confinement. Green diamonds: the slip model was assumed with molecular area confinement. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval estimate from the nonlinear regression. Surprisingly, the dissociation model had a moderate effect on the skip distance at low site densities but the confinement model had little effect. (B) The sample-normalized autocorrelation of the velocity component perpendicular to the flow direction (wobble velocity autocorrelation) was calculated and averaged together for the three simulated beads at each condition. The colors indicate the same reaction assumptions as in the previous graph. Heavy dashed lines: results from 490 sites/m2 ligand density. Intermediate dot-dashed lines: results from 190 sites/m2 ligand density. Light solid lines: results from 90 sites/m2 ligand density. Colors represent the same cases as in (A). The confinement model had the largest effect on the wobble autocorrelation.

Subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the plasma involved in coagulation are thought to have three origins: monocyte-derived EVs (blue), platelet-derived EVs (red) and endothelial cell-derived EVs (green) as outlined in the enlarged EV 3-colour pie chart. EVs contain proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis. For coagulation TF is the key initiator of the coagulation cascade and forms a complex with factor VIIa (FVIIa). This complex activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX). The activated factor X (FXa) further cleaves prothrombin into thrombin that converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form clot. For fibrinolysis, the plasmin inhibitors SERPING1 and SERPINF2 have been identified in EVs and inhibit the breakdown of a fibrin via fibrinolysis.

The simulation results agree well with the equilibrium theory and demonstrate vertical diffusion occurs over a biochemically relevant length. (B) Sampled instantaneous, flow-direction velocity probability distribution functions for a 6 m-diameter sphere (heavy blue dashed line) and a 10 m-diameter sphere (narrow red line) are shown and compared to the experimental results with microbeads possessing a nominal diameter of 6 m [39] (grey bars). The results demonstrate the experimentally observed skewing of the instantaneous velocity distribution from normal and predict a tighter velocity distribution for larger particles. (C) Contour plots of the probability distribution functions of the sampled instantaneous, flow-direction velocity for a simulated 6 m sphere (bottom) and a 10 m simulated sphere (top) at 50 s1 are shown. Each was re-normalized to the respective maximum, so the results for the 6 m-diameter sphere cover a larger area. Tabulated deterministic solutions published by Goldman et al. [40] are shown as triangles (6 m-diameter sphere) and circles (10 m-diameter sphere). Although agreement was good, the simulation slightly underpredicted the superposition result. (D) Time-domain flow-directed instantaneous velocity for a 6 m-diameter sphere (maroon line), flow-directed instantaneous velocity for a 10 m-diameter sphere (red line), gap size for a 6 m-diameter sphere (dark blue line), and gap size for a 10 m-diameter sphere (light blue line) are shown. The low-frequency fluctuations in the instantaneous velocity reflected fluctuations in the gap.

Plaque rupture is tailored by platelets in several ways: platelets are known to modulate angiogenesis, which is a decisive factor for plaque stability. Platelets have also been found to promote smooth muscle cell (SMC) progenitor recruitment via CXCR4-SDF-1 signaling. SMCs are responsible for generating extracellular matrix stabilizing the fibrous cap of the plug. Thrombus formation in areas of the ruptured fibrous cap exposing components of the extracellular matrix is initiated by platelets. Future investigations will also have to test, whether platelets enter the plaque tissue and affect tissue remodeling.

Endothelial injury and hypoxia activates HIF to initiate the expression and release of SDF-1, VEGF, c-Kit ligand (SCF), and IL-8. Circulating SDF-1 and VEGF stimulate the production of NO by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) to MMP-9. Increased MMP-9 activity disrupts EPC-stromal cell interaction to mobilize EPCs from the marrow. Concentration gradients of SDF-1 direct circulating EPCs to the site of injury. Increased surface expression of integrin 2 and selectins (selectins E and P) on the endothelium interact with specific ligands on EPCs to recruit and home EPCs. In the unstimulated cell, GSK3 phosphorylates and accelerates the degradation of HIF-1 and -catenin. Inhibition of GSK3 leads to nuclear translocation of HIF-1 and -catenin.

The L-selectinexpressing lymphocyte translates close to the ligand with hydrodynamic velocity dictated by the shear rate. At a low subthreshold shear rate, the initial L-selectinligand bond (top left) dissociates within a few ms before a second bond (e.g., on a neighboring microvillus) can form downstream of the first bond. At high threshold shear rate (top middle), the leukocyte held by the first bond may rotate rapidly enough to encounter a second ligand site (top middle) and to form a multivalent tether. This initial stabilization is conditional for a second, cytoplasmic tailmediated stabilization event (anchorage) to take place and further prolong tether lifetime, possibly via local rebinding (depicted as ). As force is loaded, the trailing microvillus extends and the cell detaches (top right). In contrast, the high affinity P-selectin<b>PSGL-1</b> bond (bottom left) lasts two orders of magnitude longer than the L-selectincarbohydrate bond, and undergoes local rebinding favored by selectin and ligand dimerization within the first occupied microvillus, often without a need for a secondary contact (bottom left). Consequently, at elevated shear rates and stresses (bottom right), the P-selectinmediated tether is therefore generally more rapidly disrupted than at low shear rates.

Lower part: Model of platelet interaction with the endothelium. Platelets interact with the endothelium via adhesion receptors such as GPIb and <b>PSGL-1</b> promoting rolling and subsequent firm adhesion via 3 integrins. Interaction with endothelial bound chemokines such as Cx3CL1 (fractalkine) or CCL5 (Rantes) results in P-Selectin mediated recruitment of leukocytes to the vessel wall and subsequent transmigration. For both interaction with the subendothelial matix and the endothelium, major adhesion receptors expressed on platelets are listed.

(a) Schematic representation of PMN extravasation in infectious and noninfectious diseases. The first contact with endothelial cells is mediated by engagement of selectins with their counterreceptor <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b>-1 (<b>PSGL-1</b>) which results in capture and rolling of PMNs. Activation of PMNs by selectins and the different inflammatory signals like chemokines while rolling induces activation of the 2 integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1) and slow rolling. Binding of activated 2 integrins to their counterreceptors ICAMs on endothelial cells induces PMN arrest due to firm adhesion and Mac-1-dependent crawling. Polarization of PMNs toward the chemoattractant source (i.e., cytoskeletal rearrangement, recruitment of regulators of Arfs, and activation of PI3K, Arf1, and NADPH oxidase at the leading edge) initiates directional sensing and transmigration across the vascular endothelium. PMNs are guided by the gradient of chemoattractant factors and after arriving at the site of infection or tissue injury, the cells initiate phagocytosis or NETosis to kill pathogens and remove cellular debris. PMN granules are schematically represented by colored circles. (b) Signalling pathways downstream of GPCRs, Fc receptor IIA (FcRIIA), and 2 integrins by which Arfs and their regulators are thought to regulate PMN functional responses are presented schematically. Green arrows indicate direct activation either through lipid-protein or through protein-protein interactions, and negative feedback mechanisms are highlighted in red. Where direct interactions have not been established and/or the signalling mechanisms are unclear, lines are dotted. Cross talk between Arf and Rho family GTPases mediated by ARAP3 and the p21 protein- (Cdc42/Rac-) activated kinase 1 (PAK1)/PAK-interacting Exchange Factor alpha (PIX) signalling complex is also shown.

These glycans can target multiple points during the inflammatory process. (A) In response to an inflammatory stimuli, such as a bacterial infection, resident macrophages in inner tissues produce both chemokines that attract more leukocytes into these inflamed tissues, and cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor, TNF) that trigger, at the early stages, the display of pre-formed P-selectins on the luminal surface of endothelial cells (the cytokine-induced P-selectin exposure is not shown at the panels). Cytokines can also induce the expression of E-selectin by endothelial cells (mechanism not shown). GAGs at endothelial proteoglycans play an important role in L-selectin binding, in chemokine presentation to chemokine receptors on neutrophils, and in the transportation of chemokines produced by tissue macrophages and further infiltrated leukocytes. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), and <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b>-1 (PSGL) are important leukocyte cell-membrane proteins involved in rolling and firm adhesion, respectively. (B) In the presence of SFs, and likely SGs, by direct contact, both P- and L-selectins are blocked to interact further with <b>PSGL-1</b>, and GAGs, respectively, thus, causing a reduction on the leukocyte recruitment. In addition, at certain concentrations, SFs and SGs sequestrate the chemokines responsible to drive and to activate the leukocytes. This is another anti-inflammatory action of these marine glycans. This sequestration occurs most likely because of the presence of conserved heparin-binding sites (BBXB motifs, where B and X are basic and neutral amino acids) in some pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES. Due to chemokine sequestration, the numbers of activated defense cells, their firm attachment to the endothelial surface and further infiltration become all consequently reduced in treatment cases. Besides those actions, the number of released chemokine as a pro-inflammatory feedback process from inner tissues is also attenuated due to the decreased number of infiltrated cells. This latter event enhances the anti-inflammatory activity of the MSPs. All mechanisms marked by X in (B) collaborate in conjunction to the resultant anti-inflammatory action of SFs and SGs.

Calcein-labeled DCs were observed in ear postcapillary venules (top  panel) after carotid injection. Continuous observation of bound cells (representative examples identified by arrowheads) reveals considerable heterogeneity of individual velocities. Three cells identified in the top panel are  observed to move significantly different distances over the 1-min period  of observation. All other cells shown have rolled out of the field of view  during the 1-min interval. During that same period, several additional  rolling cells have appeared (bottom panel). Unbound cells moved through  the field of view within &lt;1 s (not shown). The large bright areas seen between vessels are autofluorescent hair follicles. Bar, 100 m.

The yellow arrows indicate possible sequences of events. On the top left, a ligand binds to a selectin with a closed interdomain angle. A low applied force (f, short arrow) perpendicular to the binding interface favors ligand dissociation (bottom left). As applied force increases (f, long arrow), the equilibrium between the closed- and open-angle conformations shifts in favor of the open conformation (top right). This tilts the interface to align with the force direction, allowing the ligand to slide across the interface. Sliding allows new interactions to form or the original interactions to reform (rebinding). Eventually both old and new interactions break, and the ligand dissociates (bottom right).

Dissociation rate constants of neutrophil tethers mediated by immobilized cell-free wild-type L-selectin (A) or cell-free L-selectin mutated in its EGF domain (LPL) (B) at the indicated shear stresses. Insets: the frequency of neutrophils initially tethered to L-selectin (A, filled symbols) or LPL (B, filled symbols) at the indicated shear stresses. Values depict the percentage of neutrophils tethered at least once while passing at the indicated shear stresses over the immobilized selectin variants. Background tethering (open symbols) was measured in the presence of 50 g/ml fucoidin. Each L-selectin variant was isolated from pre B lymphocyte transfectants and saturably anchored on substrates (coated at 500 sites/m2) of the tail-specific mAb CA21. The most rapidly dissociating tethers (90% or more) dissociated with the indicated first-order koff. (C) Dissociation rate constants and frequency of tethering of neutrophils mediated by highly diluted immobilized LPL. At wall shear stresses indicated by asterisks, a considerable fraction of LPL-specific tethers (23 and 37% at 0.2 and 0.3 dyn/cm2, respectively) had a slower koff, similar to values obtained in B, possibly due to multivalent associations. Inset: the frequency of neutrophils initially tethered to immobilized LPL. Tethering frequencies were determined as in previous figures. A representative experiment of three is shown.

Dissociation kinetics of transiently tethered L-selectinexpressing pre B lymphocytes measured at a subthreshold shear stress of 0.3 dyn/cm2 vary dramatically with PNAd density. Tether duration points that fit a first-order dissociation curve (open and filled triangles) were connected by straight lines, with slopes equal to koff. At all densities, L-selectin tethers fit a straight line with a fast koff, k1. More than 98% of tethers formed on 10 ng/ml PNAd dissociated with this k1. At PNAd coated at 15 and 20 ng/ml, fractions of tethers fit a second straight line with a smaller slope, with a second rate constant, k2. The fractions of tethers out of the total tethers that dissociated with k2 and their dissociation rate constants are each indicated in parentheses near the corresponding plots. Inset: frequencies of tethers initiated at 0.3 dyn/cm2 by the L-selectinexpressing lymphocytes interacting with different PNAd densities. Values depict net tethering frequency after subtracting background tethering.

Tumor cells can directly induce NETosis in an individual with cancer by secretion of factors such as G-CSF and IL-8. Tumors furthermore promote platelet activation, for example, by production of tissue factor (TF). Activated platelets function as inducers of NETosis. This effect is mediated via direct binding of P-selectin on activated platelets and <b>PSGL-1</b> on neutrophils. Stimulation of platelets via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), by LPS during infectious disease or tumor-derived factors, possibly fibronectin ED-A, may further contribute to platelet-induced NETosis. NETs further stimulate platelet activation and thrombosis due to externalized chromatin and localization of TF and factor XII.

Flow was applied in the X-direction with a linear shear rate, S. A three dimensional sphere with a fixed radius, R, was coated with receptors, and each anchor point of the base of the receptor's tether region to the surface of the sphere is shown as a black dot. Only the receptors within an unstressed receptor/ligand contour length of the surface, , were allowed to form bonds. This region has been highlighted in yellow. The gap between the base of the sphere and the surface, , was allowed to vary. The diffusion of the sphere was included in the simulation. The diffusion had six components with the inclusion of rotation in the sphere's motion. Motion perpendicular to the flow direction, along the Y-axis, is referred to as wobble in the text. (B,C) Two different models of reactivity for molecules in the contact volume were included in the simulations. For contact patch confinement, described mathematically by (1), all of the receptors on the sphere within an unstressed receptor/ligand contour length of the surface were assumed to react with a constant rate. For molecular area confinement, described mathematically by (2), receptors immobilized on portions of the sphere closest to the surface were allowed to form bonds with an increased rate proportional to the area of the projection of the molecular contour length onto the XY plane. The colors in (B,C) depict the relative reaction rate of receptors, and warmer colors indicate an increased reaction rate.

Note that the step function in the freely-jointed chain model, (6), resulted in a step from zero force to 56 pN as the tether extended past 92 nm, and then force continued to increase continuously. (A) A sample of bond loading data for 6 m-diameter spheres with a 50 s1 wall shear rate. (B) Results from a simulation for 6 m-diameter spheres with a 100 s1 wall shear rate. Note that bonds were aligned to their respective initial loading points in the figure, so the total instantaneous force exerted by the concurrent bonds, shown by the green and blue tracings, on the sphere cannot be calculated by summing the two values at the same time point on the plot. (C) Bond loading results from a 10 m-diameter sphere at a 100 s1 wall shear rate. Of the three cases, the larger sphere had the most bond loading events and also was the most likely to form simultaneous hydrodynamic force bearing bonds. (D) Loading trajectories for single, force-bearing bonds. Data were compiled from simulation runs for 10 m-diameter spheres with a 100 s1 wall shear rate. Individual tracings represent individual bond events, with position coordinates representing the position of the bond tether point on the sphere relative to the center, projected onto the XY plane.

In humans (left), platelet activation induces thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation, which triggers the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and platelet factor 4 (PF4). vWF binds to its platelet receptor, glycoprotein (GP)Ib, which binds to CD18 in neutrophils. PF4 and HMGB1 act directly upon neutrophils and induce DNA release. In mice, not only TXA2 generation and HMGB1 are involved but also PF4 and RANTES, through GPCR, induce platelet-mediated NET formation. Also, the interaction between P-selectin-<b>PSGL-1</b> and IIb3-Mac-1 is required for the release of NETs.

Bone marrow HSCs enter into the thymus through CMJ, a process mediated by CCL12 and CCL25 in the embryonic thymus and by the interaction between P-selectin and its cognate ligand <b>PSGL-1</b> in adult thymus. Stimulation by IL-7 allows the relocation of DN thymocytes from the cortex to the subcapsular region. DP thymocytes bearing TCR and capable of binding to self-MHC ligands are positively selected. This process is regulated by Pssr6 and b5t, which are expressed in cTECs. Developing thymocytes are relocated from cortex to the medulla by chemotactic attraction between CCR7 and the ligands CCL19/CCL21, expressed on the mTECs. Into medulla, self-reactive thymocytes are deleted through the negative selection, a process mediated by dendritic cells and Aire-expressing mTECs.

Neurons and astrocytes damaged by ischemia release pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF- into the brain parenchyma. These pro-inflammatory molecules in turn diffuse and bind receptors on vascular endothelial cells. Activation of endothelial cells via TNF and related receptors leads to nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) activation and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NFB activity induces transcription of adhesion molecules and chemokines, including E-selectin, P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM1) and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. Peripheral immune cells traveling through the vasculature express receptors to adhesion molecules (i.e. <b>PSGL-1</b> for selectins, 4-integrin for VCAM1).

(A) Activated platelets initially tether to granulocytes via Pselectin/<b>PSGL1</b> interactions, where they activate the classical pathway(CP) on their surface and/or secrete chondroitin sulfate, a known activator of the CP. (B) Properdinenhanced alternative pathway(AP) activity amplifies CP activity initiated by platelets, leading to the deposition of C3b on the granulocyte surface. The AP can then use deposited C3b to amplify its activity directly on the granulocyte surface. The AP also activates spontaneously on (C) neutrophils and activated platelets, and (D) AP activity is enhanced by high levels of properdin oligomers (P2, P3, and especially P4), secreted from neutrophils.

The closeness between sinusoidal endothelial cells and HSCs is very important for their maturation and so for the hematopoietic process. An arteriolar niche has been found where quiescent HSCs are associated with a cell population different from CAR, named peri-arteriolar nestin cells.

Moreover, CXCL4 decreases HIV infection but also enhances liver fibrosis. CCL5, another -granule-derived chemokine, also decreases HIV infection and enhances Th1 lymphocyte responses in HCV infection and serves as a survival signal for macrophages in influenza infection. Platelets release PMPs and -defensins from their -granules, which mediate virus neutralization. They protect splenocytes from necrosis in LCMV infection. Platelet dense granules contain 5-HT, which enables liver regeneration but also HBV and HCV infection. Platelet activation leads to the expression and release of CD154 and CD62P, which allow direct interaction between platelets and leukocytes. Platelet interaction with B-lymphocytes enhances germinal center formation and antiviral IgG production. Platelets trigger T-lymphocyte differentiation and cytotoxicity as well as survival and differentiation of monocytes. In neutrophils, platelet adhesion stimulates ROS production and boosts phagocytosis. Platelet interaction with dendritic cells promotes their maturation and facilitates antigen presentation. Finally, platelet activation results in interaction and activation of further platelets, which triggers platelet aggregation and amplifies the above described processes.

Peripherally, nave T cells (N) encounter APC that present peptides from aberrant, misfolded, or aggregated proteins associated with neuroinflammatory processes. Upon presentation of antigen and delivery of appropriate co-stimulatory signals by APC, nave T cells recognizing the antigen/MHC complex via the TCR become activated (A) leading to upregulation of CAMs on the T cell surface. These receptors and ligands include, but are not limited to, integrins, MCAM, and <b>PSGL-1</b>. Similarly, at sites of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation, danger signals, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines induce upregulation of endothelial associated CAMs on the basolateral side of the blood brain barrier. Following upregulation of CAMs, activated T cells (such as pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or regulatory T cells) enter the vasculature and begin the process of extravasation via either a trans- or para-cellular route. This migratory process occurs in a step-wise manner beginning with T cells loosely tethering to endothelial cells via the binding of T cell ligands to selectins, such as E-selectin and other CAMs, such as VCAM, ICAM, and laminin 411 on the luminal side of the endothelial cells. Loose tethering allows the cell to roll along the luminal side of the endothelium and interact with CAMs, pulling it closer to the endothelial cell layer to eventual capture. Upon clustering of receptors and ligands on T cell and endothelial cell surfaces, the T cell begins &quot;crawling&quot; across the endothelial surface until reaching an endothelial cell junction, which signals the initiation of extravasation. Transmigration proceeds, via a chemotactic gradient allowing antigen-specific T cells entrance to the brain. Once in the parenchyma, activated T cells recognize antigen presented by MHC, initiating the efferent response program of the T cells to deliver either effector or regulatory function that supports the respective neurodegenerative or neuroprotective outcome.

The rupture rate may be viewed as the product of the frequency of attempts at crossing times the success probability that is proportional to Boltzmanns factor exp(W/kBT). Applying a force will decrease the barrier height by the product F.d, i.e., the force times the distance between the barrier and the equilibrium distance, thus multiplying the escape frequency by exp(Fd/kBT).

(A) Properdin is released from activated neutrophils and is bound to the cell membrane where it recruits C3b to form the alternative pathway C3 convertases. C5a then activates additionally neutrophils and they secrete more properdin. This installs a vicious cycle of neutrophil and complement activation. (B) Properdin released from neutrophils or in the plasma binds to activated platelets promoting C3(H2O) recruitment and complement activation. (C) Stimulation of endothelial cells with C3a, heme, or other agonists induces expression of P-selectin. P-selectin contains CCP domains and binds C3b, promoting formation of C3 convertases that generate more C3a to stimulate cells.

B) Images of cycloheximide-treated P2 cells expressing Gag-YFP were acquired after 3-h coculture with CMTMR-stained SupT1 cells in the presence or absence of DMSO or ML7. Note that almost all the cells adopt round unpolarized morphology upon treatment with ML7 and that ML7-treated infected cells show dispersed Gag-YFP localization. The latter point is clearer in the higher magnification image (bottom panel) of a region specified in the middle row. Also note that the cell density of the cocultures in experiments shown in panel A (images shown in Figure S3 and discussed in Text S1) is 10 fold higher than in panel B.

Under such conditions, aged vessels have a compromised vasodilation, inducing endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired tissue perfusion. Moreover, the atherosclerosis process is accompanied by a low-grade inflammation, which could be favored by endothelial dysfunction. The recruitment of leukocytes into areas of inflammation is mediated by interacting sets of cell adhesion molecules (showed step by step in order of activation). T-cells and monocytes are the first cells infiltrating the arterial intima, and represent a hallmark of endothelial damage favoring the early stages of atherogenesis. In atherosclerosis, focal expression of key adhesion molecules, mainly triggered by plasma atherogenic lipoproteins, may also mediate the recruitment of mononuclear cells to the plaque. Among these adhesion molecules, ICAM-1, a protein of the Ig superfamily, and one of the ligands for LFA-1, has been suggested to play an important role in atherogenesis. Thus, the increased ICAM-1 expression detected in this study could be associated with an enhanced recruitment of monocytes and T lymphocytes. Finally, in advanced stages, immune cells function also decline, contributing to inflammation and vascular damage and triggering CVD risk. (Modified from Gonzlez-Amaro R. [51]).

Preparation of a scFv (B) resulted in a monovalent molecule which failed to bind to slanDCs (C, data not shown). For recovery of binding avidity a scBsDb (D, SL scBsDb) and suitable linking peptide molecules (F,G) were constructed (H,I). In the scBsDb the variable heavy and light chain domains of the two mabs (A, DD2, S; E, 7B6, L) are recombinantly fused via glycine serine linkers (D; see also Fig. 3). This SL scBsDb is on the one hand directed to the slan epitope and on the other hand to a continuous peptide epitope (l-Tag). The linker peptide modules contain the l-Tag either two times (l-GFP-l, F) or three times (l-l-GFP-l, G(i); l-TTp-l-GFP-l, G(ii)). Binding of the SL scBsDb to the respective linker peptides results in the formation of a divalent (H) or trivalent (I) anti-slan scaffold with increased avidity.

(Phase I) Neutrophils (N) interact with circulating platelets (PLT): after recognition of platelet P-selectin by the P-selectin granulocyte ligand 1 (<b>PSGL1</b>), neutrophils implement their engagement with platelets by upregulating Mac-1 (also known as M2 or CD11b/CD18), a surface integrin that interacts with platelet-bound fibrinogen in cooperation with glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa (also known as 2b3 integrin). The activation of neutrophils (possibly further enhanced by CD40CD40 ligand (CD40L) interactions) results in the release of enzymatic moieties such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), proteinase 3 (PR3) and of the prestored soluble pattern recognition receptor pentraxin (PTX)3 as well as in the expression of tissue factor (TF), which in turn promotes thrombin generation. Platelets also release various bioactive signals such as leukotrienes (LTs), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF), lysosphingolipids (LPs), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT). (Phase II) Recognition of phosphatidylserine (P-Ser) on platelets prompts their phagocytic clearance and quenches their procoagulant capacity; neutrophil ADPases break the auto/paracrine loop of ADP-mediated platelet activation. Neutrophils that had phagocytosed platelets become largely anergic after degranulation.

Leukocytes tether and roll along the vascular endothelium via selectin-mediated adhesion. They are then activated by chemokines into a high avidity, high affinity state so that integrin-mediated strong adhesion and arrest can take place. This prepares the leukocyte for transmigration through the blood vessel wall into the inflamed colon. Chemokine activation can be inhibited by various chemokine/chemokine receptor inhibitors such as the CCR9 small molecule antagonist Traficet-EN, a monoclonal antibody to CXCR3 or a CXCR2 antagonist (shown in blue).

Blood samples are lysed and processed using the 2-inlet, 4-outlet spiral microdevice for efficient size-based neutrophil sorting. The purified neutrophils are used for in vitro cell rolling assay in a microchannel functionalized with E-selectin, as well as shape measurement (neutrophil circularity). (B) Schematic illustration of DFF separation principle. Under the influence of Dean vortices, small cellular constituents (platelets and lysed RBCs) and free haemoglobin migrate laterally towards inner wall and back to outer wall due to Dean drag forces (FD (yellow arrows)). Larger leukocytes experience additional strong inertial lift forces (FL (red arrows)) and due to the strong dependence of FL and FD on cell size, larger neutrophils/monocytes (1012m) focus closer to the inner wall and are sorted into outlet 2 while smaller lymphocytes (~78m) are collected at outlet 3. Outlet 4 is used for removal of platelets, lysed RBCs and free haemoglobin.

(A) Human rhinovirus 2 undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis after interaction with LDLR. (B) CD4 is the primary receptor for HIVs, but virus penetration requires further interactions with chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. Initial observations indicated that coreceptor engagement triggered fusion directly at the plasma membrane; however, recent studies suggest that fusion can also occur after endocytosis (Miyauchi et al., 2009). Although these mechanisms appear mutually exclusive, it is possible that both may operate, and additional studies are required to establish the relevant pathway for key target cells in vivo. (C) HCV entry requires at least four host factors. The virus particle is thought to directly interact with SR-B1 and CD81, whereas the tight junction components claudin-1 and occludin are indirectly involved. Data suggest that CD81/claudin-1 heteromers are necessary for infection. It is currently unknown how HCV is directed to clathrin-coated vesicles.

Injection of IL-7 augmented the base level of C and C pro-B (C and D), but failed to rescue pre-B and downstream B cell maturation (FH).

Osx+ cell produces IL-7 and IGF-1, and both molecules are required to support full B lineage differentiation. While IL-7, also likely produced by other stomal cell types, mediates hematopoietic differentiation from early B cell precursors to pre-B cells, Osx+ cell secretion of IGF-1 is necessary for further B cell maturation from pre-B to mature B. In comparison, Ocn+ cell expresses the Notch ligand DLL4, which binds to cell-surface Notch receptor on the Tcell-competent Ly6D CLP population (Yu etal., 2015a). This engagement ensures Tcell progenitor production, and expression of the chemotactic molecules CCR7 and <b>PSGL1</b> for subsequent thymic seeding. The precise balance of Osx+ and Ocn+ osteolineage cells within the bone marrow niche is critical for both B and T lymphopoiesis, as perturbation of this balance leads to specific loss of B or T immune cells.Error bars represent  SEM.

Two possible mechanisms of transmigration are described: (a) paracellular - between endothelial cells; and (b) transcellular - through endothelial cells. Major groups of adhesion molecules are marked. Rolling depends mostly on selectins, whereas adhesion, crawling and transmigration depend on integrin interactions. Chemokines lining the lumen of the vascular endothelium activate rolling neutrophils, thus inducing conformational changes of the integrins on the surface of the neutrophils and facilitating the subsequent events. Crawling neutrophils follow the chemokine gradient along the endothelium, which leads them to the preferential sites of transmigration. Figure adapted from ref. 26

A TEV-protease cleavage site followed by a FLAG-tag was introduced into APLP2 isoform 763 starting after amino acid M653 (APLP2TF). The TEV-FLAG site is positioned 39 amino acids N-terminally of the assumed start of the transmembrane domain (TMD). Shedding yields sAPLP2TF, which was immunoprecipitated and digested with TEV-protease, leading to a small peptide harboring the N-terminal FLAG-tag as well as the C-terminal cleavage site resulting from the shedding. This peptide was analyzed in a mass spectrometer. (B) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the APLP2TF construct and either treated with TAPI-1 (50 M) or DMSO as a solvent control. Upon TAPI-1 treatment secreted sAPLP2TF levels were clearly decreased in the conditioned medium of the cells. An accumulation of APLP2TF levels was observed upon TAPI-1 treatment in the cell lysate. Actin was analyzed in the cell lysate as a loading control. (C) Peptides produced according to the scheme in A were obtained from HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing APLP2TF and either luciferase as a control, ADAM10 or BACE1. Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides revealed two peaks for control and ADAM10 overexpression (*,**) while upon BACE1 overexpression only one peak with a lower m/z ratio was observed. Total Ion Counts (TIC) and centroid peak masses of the first isotopic peak are given for each isotopic peak cluster. All peaks are revealed from singly-charged peptides. (D) Determined (Det.) masses of the peaks in C (*,**,***) were compared to calculated (calc.) masses. For each mass, a corresponding peptide could be computed with less than 0.5 Da error. (E) Western Blot analysis of the samples used in C. sAPLP2TF was detected in the conditioned media, full-length APLP2 (APLP2TF), ADAM10 (A10, # immature and ## mature), BACE1 and calnexin as a loading control were detected in the cell lysates. A clear increase in sAPLP2TF levels was observed upon ADAM10 and BACE1 overexpression. sAPLP2TF has a slightly reduced apparent molecular weight upon BACE1 overexpression if compared to control (Con). (F) Summary of known ADAM10 cleavage sites in different substrates aligned with the newly detected ADAM10 cleavage site for APLP2 [41]. (G) Schematic comparison of the ectodomain shedding sites of APP and APLP2. The APP -cleavage occurs 12 amino acids N-terminally of the transmembrane domain (TMD), for APLP2 it occurs 22 amino acids N-terminally of the TMD. For both proteins -cleavage occurs N-terminally of an aspartate.

During sepsis, activated platelets attach to neutrophils via a selectin dependent process, namely the release and expression P-selectin of platelet from a-granules which binds to the counter ligand <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b> (PSGL) expressed on neutophils. Besides that, activated platelet can expression CD40L and then shed it into circulation. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)1, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells together with CD40L interact with neutrophils which can further promote the activation of neutophils and its generation of reaction oxygen species (ROS). For platelet-expressed CD40L, it can also interact with CD40 on endothelial cells to stimulate the endothelial cell to a pro-inflammatory phenotype: upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)1, thereby driving neutrophil recruitment. The platelet can also mediate the formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) via the interaction of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, which can trap free bacteria and enhance the platelet and red blood cell (RBC) adhesion to promote thrombus formation.

Mast cells release both histamine and S1P that can both mobilize P-selectin independently through the H1 and S1P3 receptor, respectively. However, histamine achieves full scale P-selectin mobilization by additional Gq-dependent activation of Sphk1, S1P production/release and subsequent activation of S1P3. Other P-selectin mobilizing agents such as epinephrine that require cAMP for P-selectin mobilization also employ Sphk1 for full-blown effect but do so through a Gs/AC/cAMP-dependent pathway. S1P1 plays an inhibitory effect on P-selectin-dependent rolling by reducing AC-induced Sphk1 activity through Gi. DOP and pFTY720 act in an inhibitory manner on rolling by downregulating S1P1 and S1P3, but in addition, pFTY720 directly inhibits the Gq-dependent part of S1P-incuded S1P3-dependent P-selectin mobilization. In summary, the pro-rolling effect of S1P3 dominates over the anti-rolling of S1P1, and the net effect of acute S1P exposure is an overall increase in P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling.

When the thymic niche is occupied (left), a signal generated by ETPs or niche cells inhibits P-selectin and CCL25 expression by the endothelium. Over a period of 2 wk, some ETP niches become vacant, relieving the inhibitory signal and leading to increased P-selectin and CCL25 expression (right). TPCs are then able to home into the thymus and give rise to ETPs, restarting the clock. Alternatively, when a niche is empty, niche cells may release a factor that promotes endothelial P-selectin and CCL25 expression and is consumed by ETPs.

A) Production of inflammatory mediators during inflammation can increase the number of committed progenitor cells. B) Chemotactic mediators released during inflammation can provoke the recruitment of stem cells from the circulation to the site of inflammation where they undergo a rapid proliferation phase, followed by terminal differentiation into inflammatory cells (mast cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, etc) at the site of the inflammatory reaction, contributing to development and chronicity of disease. C) Inflammatory mediators provoke the release of proteases (MMPs) by granulocytes or stem cells within the bone marrow, which cleave the molecular anchors of stem cells and increase their release in the circulation.

L-selectin mediates the recruitment of leukocytes to tumor cells. These transit metastatic emboli include leucocytes and function as vehicles that shield the tumor cell from shear force and immunosurveillance (NK cells). The expression of E- and P-selectin on endothelial cells initiates tethering and rolling of tumor cells. This weak adhesion to the endothelium promotes establishment of the metastatic niche usually associated with more definitive binding to intercellular cell adhesion molecules. b Heparins bind to selectins and inhibit their function
808	PMC5277199	/imgs/512/39/5277199/PMC5277199_fcvm-04-00002-g001.png	F1	Atherosclerotic plaque progression. (A) Endothelial cells activated by disturbed flow and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake express adhesion molecules and chemoattractant proteins that recruit monocytes and promote their adhesion to the endothelium and transmigration into the subendothelium. These monocytes differentiate into macrophages. (B) Macrophages uptake oxLDL sequestered in the subendothelium eventually becoming lipid-laden foam cells. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can migrate to the subendothelium where they lose expression of SMC markers and gain expression of macrophage markers. This allows them to ingest lipids and eventually become foam cells contributing to plaque progression. (C) These foam cells eventually undergo apoptosis and necroptosis, and, if not effectively cleared by M2 macrophages via efferocytosis, undergo secondary necrosis contributing to the formation of the necrotic core. As the necrotic core grows and the fibrous cap thins, the plaque is vulnerable to rupture, which may result in acute cardiovascular events such as thrombosis. (D) VSMCs near the cap of the plaque secrete extracellular matrix components that contribute to the formation of a fibrous cap that protects the plaque from rupturing. M2 macrophages express anti-inflammatory markers that act to reduce the inflammation of the plaque. They also perform efferocytosis, thereby reducing the apoptotic and necrotic cells within the plaque and promoting plaque stability.

Glycan determinant data and their connections with human glycoproteins and related diseases are depicted for C.glabrata N-Epa-p (A), and C.albicans N-Als-p (B). Closeup views of the networks are shown on the right. The nodes dimensions and arrow thickness/label size depend on the number of connections, and the glycan-binding strength, respectively (see the legend to Fig.1). Notably, the determinants Gal(1-4)GlcNAc (A) and Fuc(1-2)Gal (B) are both characterized by a high number of connections (large node, i.e., several human glycoproteins are characterized by the presence of these glycan determinant) but a low relevance. No label is shown; i.e., the Epa/Als intensities of binding to the glycans that contains these determinants are lower than the other determinants. The program filters out the node labels on the basis of the lectin binding intensity and displays only the labels of the most relevant glycan determinants (see the supplemental material).

(A)  Scheme for measurement of  the lever arm by reversing  the direction of flow. The lever arm, l, is the distance between the tether point and  the projection of the center  of the neutrophil on the substrate. (B) Estimation of  forces on a neutrophil tethered in shear flow (drawn to  scale). The force balance  equations are Fb cos = Fs  and Fblsin = s + RFs,  where Fb is the force on the  tether bond, Fs is the force on  the cell, and s is the torque  on the cell. The exact solution for Fs for a motionless  hard sphere in shear flow  near a wall is Fs = 6viscosityRhshearC where R is sphere radius, h is the distance from the center of the cell to the wall, and C is a numerical factor determined  by integration that depends on h/R and ranges from 1 to 1.7 (17). With R = 4.25 m for a neutrophil (48), variation of hR from 0 to 0.5  m has little effect on Fs (3%), and we have assumed h = R for a tethered cell. The assumption of hardness is good because no neutrophil deformation is visible microscopically within the range of shear used here. Roughness such as from microvilli is thought to increase Fs only modestly; for a rough object, Fs is intermediate between Fs on a sphere contained in the object and Fs on a sphere containing the object. We estimate uncertainty in R to measurement variation (48) and its effective increase by microvilli as 0.25 m. The  calculated value of Fs and its uncertainty are 59.8  6.9 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. Both the uncertainty in R and in the lever arm  measurement l = 3.06  0.53 m introduce uncertainties into the other calculated values. The uncertainties stemming from R and l  were estimated separately for these values and their variances were added. We calculate  = 62.3  4.2, d = 1.0  0.32 m, Fb/Fs = 2.15   0.32, and Fb = 124.4  26.1 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress.

The vertical dashed line marks the left boundary of the tethered  cell before flow reversal. (D) Measurement of the lever arm. Each point is a measurement on an individual cell; the lever arm is defined  as half the distance moved during flow reversal while cells were tethered to the indicated density of P-selectin. Shear stress was calibrated from the hydrodynamic velocity of cells in the same chamber using a syringe pump. (E) Velocities after flow reversal of untethered neutrophils and of neutrophils transiently tethered to P-selectin (five sites per m2). The velocity of tethered cells was derived  from a frame by frame analysis of the number of video frames required for a transiently tethered cell to move the distance of 2 l after  flow reversal. Values are the average of two velocity determinations at each wall shear stress. Velocities of cells free in flow (i.e., untethered, traveling at the hydrodynamic velocity) were determined in the same video segments. Velocities of cells free in flow are the mean  of four determinations. Similar velocity determination of cells free in flow was performed on an identical field using a syringe pump generating known wall shear stresses, and the shear stress was calibrated from these velocities. The movement of indicator nontethered  cells in the same field of view was observed to mark flow reversal, and time was not counted until indicator cells reached full velocity  (dead time was about one frame at the lowest shears).

The uncertainties stemming from R and l  were estimated separately for these values and their variances were added. We calculate  = 62.3  4.2, d = 1.0  0.32 m, Fb/Fs = 2.15   0.32, and Fb = 124.4  26.1 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. (C) Movement of a representative transiently tethered neutrophil on  P-selectin at five sites per m2 during reversal of flow at 0.3 dyn/cm2. The vertical dashed line marks the left boundary of the tethered  cell before flow reversal. (D) Measurement of the lever arm. Each point is a measurement on an individual cell; the lever arm is defined  as half the distance moved during flow reversal while cells were tethered to the indicated density of P-selectin. Shear stress was calibrated from the hydrodynamic velocity of cells in the same chamber using a syringe pump. (E) Velocities after flow reversal of untethered neutrophils and of neutrophils transiently tethered to P-selectin (five sites per m2). The velocity of tethered cells was derived  from a frame by frame analysis of the number of video frames required for a transiently tethered cell to move the distance of 2 l after  flow reversal. Values are the average of two velocity determinations at each wall shear stress. Velocities of cells free in flow (i.e., untethered, traveling at the hydrodynamic velocity) were determined in the same video segments. Velocities of cells free in flow are the mean  of four determinations. Similar velocity determination of cells free in flow was performed on an identical field using a syringe pump generating known wall shear stresses, and the shear stress was calibrated from these velocities. The movement of indicator nontethered  cells in the same field of view was observed to mark flow reversal, and time was not counted until indicator cells reached full velocity  (dead time was about one frame at the lowest shears).

After lysing single cells by heating, cDNA is obtained by retrotranscription with as many specific primers as genes studied. The cDNA template is subjected to a 10-cycle pre-amplification reaction using a primer pair for each gene studied in order to maintain the linear ratio of the original sample. The pre-amplified product is split into aliquots for qPCR analysis with SYBR-Green using the same primer pairs as in the pre-amplification step. B) Efficiency of qPCR reactions after pre-amplification using 10-fold dilutions of standards did not show significant differences between the genes studied. C) Similar qPCR Ct values between samples using either single or multiplex RT primers indicate no primer competition during the retrotranscription reaction. D) Similar qPCR Ct values between samples using either single or multiplex primer pairs indicate no primer competition during the 10-cycle pre-amplification reaction. E) Quantification of varied copy number for a particular gene amplified in the presence of a constant number of plasmids for the other genes studied. For each reaction, 102 (purple line), 104 (blue line), or 106 (red line) plasmids were mixed with a constant number (104) of plasmids for the other eight genes studied. Gene specific multiplex qPCR amplification was then performed. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. F) Regression lines obtained from standard curves for each gene with the single cell RT-qPCR conditions. R2-values were greater than 0.990 with detection limit of 100 copies for most genes.

The above adhesion induces secretion of several cytokines (IL-6, VEGF, HGF, IGF-1, SDF-1, TNF-, MCP-1) by BMSCs leading to triggering most of above pathways and induction of resistance to apoptosis and drugs in MM cells (paracrine). IL-6 can also stimulate MM cells in an autocrine manner, although this system has been shown for some other cytokines as well. Furthermore, most above cytokines may also be secreted by osteoclasts, endothelial cells and macrophages during their direct or indirect interactions with MM cells leading to triggering of above functional responses in latter cells.

(A) Under steady state  conditions, the recruitment of DC precursors into tissues and the migration of mature DCs to lymph nodes occur at low rates. Tissue antigens  carried by short-lived migratory DCs may be transferred to resident lymphoid DCs that induce T cell tolerance. (B) Activated endothelial cells recruit DCs at higher rates. Immature DCs are attracted by inflammatory  chemokines towards the site of inflammation, where bacterial and viral  products induce DC maturation and activation. In the lymph node, activated T cells can further enhance DC activation and survival via CD40L  and TRANCE. Because many and highly activated DCs are present, a  productive T cell response is induced. (C) Mature DCs that fail to migrate  to lymph nodes may serve as nucleation sites for chronic inflammatory reaction. Chemokines produced by these DCs attract maturing DCs as well  as recently activated T cells, that maintain the inflammatory reaction.  Thick lines indicate activated cells.

Agilent's whole human genome DNA microarray was employed for this analysis. (A) Presentation of mosaic tiles for the 33 and 3 PREP genes whose expressions are up-regulated (&gt;1.2-fold change) or down-regulated (&lt;1.0-fold change) in all seven CSS patients as compared with healthy volunteers. The gene names are indicated on the right of the panels. The PREP genes were selected by a filter and their expressions in all seven cases of CSS patients were grouped together by using GeneSpring software 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). In other words, their raw expression values were normalized according to the manufacturer's instructions by conducting a ratio calculation of the two channels. This was followed by a per-gene normalization to ensure all ratios for each gene were normalized to 1. The nine conspicuously up-regulated PREP genes (&gt;2.0-fold change) are denoted by arrows; the five large arrows signify more enhanced up-regulation (&gt;2.5-fold change). Tile colors indicate the mean relative transcript level; green corresponds to a log10 ratio of 0.01 (down-regulation), red corresponds to a log10 ratio of 100 (up-regulation), and yellow indicates unchanged (bottom-most panel) when CSS and normal PBMCs are compared (bottom-most panel). (B) Graphical presentation of the nine CSS-up-regulated and three CSS-down-regulated PREP genes (denoted by arrows in Fig. 5A). Mean values were plotted for the genes that showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) difference in expression. The ordinate scale indicates relative log ratio values.

A, single letter amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Black letters define the polybasic, membrane proximal domain. The box and ovals depict amino acid residues that have been previously shown to contribute to binding CaM and ERM, respectively (see Refs. 5, 6, 9 for more detail). Underlined region of the L-selectin tail marks the epitope recognized by the CA21 monoclonal antibody. B, Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel showing the relative binding of moesin FERM or CaM to the L-selectin beads, which were pre-saturated with (lanes 1-5) or without (lanes 6-9) CaM. 5 g/ml of CaM was used to preload the beads prior to incubation with increasing amounts of moesin FERM domain. Coomassie-stained gels are representative of three independent experiments. C, binding of moesin FERM domain and CaM to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin is calcium-independent. The L-selectin beads were preloaded with either moesin FERM (lanes 1 and 2) or CaM (lanes 3 and 4). Preloaded beads were then incubated with CaM and moesin FERM, respectively. Binding reaction was supplemented either with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) 5 mm EGTA. Bound proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel is representative of three independent experiments. D, biotin transfer of SBED from the L-selectin tail to either moesin FERM domain or CaM is equal and independent of pre-mixing (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Materials and Methods for more information of SBED biotin transfer procedure). In brief, 3.6 m SBED-conjugated L-selectin tail was mixed with 4.6 m CaM and/or moesin FERM at room temperature for 30 min. In mixing experiments, a 30-min gap was left between adding proteins, which was deemed ample time for the first protein to bind to the L-selectin tail. The left-hand top and bottom panels represent PVDF transfer membranes developed with 1 g/ml streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The right-hand top and bottom panels represent the same PVDF membranes from the left-hand panels, which were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue to show relative abundance of CaM and moesin FERM used in the experiment (loading control), and is representative of three independent experiments. E, equal concentrations of CaM (4.6 m) or moesin FERM (4.6 m) were mixed individually or together with increasing amounts of soluble L-selectin tail peptide (i.e. 0, 1.72, 3.44, 6.88, 13.75, 27.50, 55, 110, and 220 m). Protein products were cross-linked with DSS, resolved on polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to a PVDF membrane for Western blotting with CA21 monoclonal anti-L-selectin tail antibody. Shifts in molecular masses of the L-selectin tail corresponded to the molecular mass of CaM (18 kDa), moesin FERM (30 kDa), or a mixture of the two (50 kDa). The arrow to the right of the molecular weight markers denotes the higher molecular weight complexes that likely correspond to a 1:1:1 stoichiometry between the tail of L-selectin, CaM, and moesin FERM. The Western blot is representative of three independent experiments.

The construct consists of an N-terminal HA-tag (HA), a linker region consisting of five glycines (5G), the APLP2CTF sequence (APLP2) and an C-terminal FLAG-tag (FLAG). Upon -secretase cleavage, peptides harboring the -secretase cleavage site at their C-terminus were liberated. Peptides were immunoprecipitated using HA-affinity agarose and subsequently analyzed in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. (B) Western Blot to confirm the -secretase sensitivity of the construct. Cells stably expressing HA-APLP2CTF-FLAG were treated with (M) or without (C, control) the -secretase inhibitor Merck A. In the presence of Merck A the CTFs accumulated in the lysate. The same was observed for cells grown in light (L) or heavy (H) medium. CTFs were detected with anti-FLAG antibody. Calnexin levels were analyzed as a loading control. (C+D) Mass spectrometry-based identification of the -secretase cleavage sites. Under control conditions, seven peaks were detected with a maximal total ion count of 497. Upon Merck A treatment, the intensity (ion count) for the peaks was reduced significantly. Peaks are labeled with identifiers #1#7 linking them to the respective peptides sequences in the table (D). All peptides were detected with a mass error of less than 0.3 Da. (E) Determination of the labeling efficiency for the SILAC experiment. To determine the labeling efficiency, proteins from the cell lysates of the heavy labeled cells from (F) were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. One band was cut out and tryptic in gel digestion was performed. Peptides resulting from this digestion were analyzed in an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified by database search, and the labeling efficiency (Label. Eff.) was determined from the heavy to light ratios (Heavy/Light) of the quantifiable peptides. Further, coverage of the proteins in % (Coverage), number of unique peptides identified (Peptides), molecular weight of respective protein (MW), SEQUEST score (Score) and number of unique peptides used for quantification (H/L Count) are given. (F) Analysis of -secretase-dependent CTF cleavage by quantitative mass spectrometry. Upper panel: Cells without Merck A (Control) grown either in light or in heavy medium. Supernatants were combined, peptides immunoprecipitated and analyzed in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Peaks resulting from the light and the heavy labeled peptides are clearly separated (+10 Da as expected for one heavy labeled arginine). Intensities of corresponding heavy and light peak clusters are not identical, as the heavy clusters are either shifted (+10 Da) or supershifted (+16 Da) due to additional incorporation of a heavy proline resulting from arginine- to-proline conversion. Lower panel: upon treatment of the light labeled cells with Merck A and the heavy labeled cells with DMSO as a solvent control, the ratio between the intensity of the light labeled peptides and the heavy labeled peptides is significantly reduced if compared to the control experiment. This demonstrates that the identified peptide peaks are generated by -secretase. (G) Comparison of the position of the - and -secretase cleavage sites of APP and APLP2 in an alignment of the juxtamembrane and the transmembrane region of these two proteins. The dark boxes mark the predicted transmembrane domains (TMD), while the light box indicates amino acids which could potentially still be part of the transmembrane domain, as they do not harbor charges.

Detection of free Ca2+ gradients by CASR renders CXCR4 significantly more sensitive to SDF-1, which is low in abundance [18]. Together, Ca+2 and SDF-1 gradients guide the LT-HSC to the endosteal niche, where they can interact with SNO (Spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45 osteoblastic) cells via N-cadherin. LT-HSC migration to the endosteum might occur via VLA-5 interaction with fibronectin in the extracellular matrix or through the action of reticular cells directing the HSC within the BM.

It was reported that Ca2+ signals triggered by the apical adhesion molecules were initiated by stores from the endoplasmic reticulum but that PECAM-1 Ca2+ transients occurred rather local at transmigration sites through the TRPC6 channel. Ca2+ signals trigger the activation of actomyosin-mediated pulling on endothelial junctions, influence the phosphorylation of components of the VE-cadherin-catenin complex, and trigger the recycling of the lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) vesicle compartment. For a more detailed depiction of intracellular signaling steps, the reader is referred to recent reviews79. (B) When leukocytes have already transmigrated more than halfway through the site of diapedesis, RhoA-mediated signaling triggered by the RHO guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Ect2 and LARG stimulates ROCK2b, which activates actomyosin-based forces that support pore confinement, which leads to closure of the diapedesis pore87.

(B,F) Receptors were randomly distributed over the surface. Fluid flow was started. Forces and torques were calculated, a diffusive component was added, the new sphere position and rotation was calculated, and receptors were tested for bond formation. (C,G) The sphere was translated and rotated into the new position. One bond formed in the calculation from the previous step. New force calculations on the bonds and sphere were performed. The bond's green color indicates the sphere had not yet moved enough to begin mechanically stressing the bond. The new sphere position and rotation was calculated based on the forces and toques plus the diffusive component, then free receptors were tested for formation, and the existing bond was tested for breakage with the current position. (D,H) The sphere was translated and rotated into the new position. The brighter sphere coloring indicates the sphere moved closer to the ligand-coated surface. Vertical motion was significant compared to the length of a bond. The bond from the previous step was still present, and a new bond formed. If the new bond were to survive until it became stressed, it would exert a force perpendicular to the flow direction that will cause the sphere to wobble because it is off the sphere's center line. Force calculations on the bonds and sphere were performed. The red color indicates the trailing bond was stressed and exerted forces and torques on the sphere. Next, the diffusive component would be added to the forces and torques on the sphere, the new sphere position and rotation would be calculated, then free receptors would be tested for formation and the existing bonds would be tested for breakage. The position would be updated and the calculation iterated.

(D) A comparison of simulated bond loadings for the rope tether results in (A), top, and the freely-jointed chain in (B), bottom. Each sampled point on the inset is spaced by 1 ms. In both cases, the sphere's pause tended to be supported by a singly-loaded bond. The decreased stiffness of the freely-jointed chain tether resulted in a smaller standard deviation of the supported force.

All other cells shown have rolled out of the field of view  during the 1-min interval. During that same period, several additional  rolling cells have appeared (bottom panel). Unbound cells moved through  the field of view within &lt;1 s (not shown). The large bright areas seen between vessels are autofluorescent hair follicles. Bar, 100 m. (b) Attachment and rolling of cultured DCs in wild-type mice (51 cells in a 28-m-diameter venule; mean blood flow velocity = 890.6 m/s, Vcrit = 388.2  m/s) and E/P-selectin double-deficient mice (64 cells in a 34-m-diameter venule; mean blood flow velocity = 1,281 m/s, Vcrit = 471.7 m/ s). Vcrit, the velocity of an idealized noninteracting cell (i.e., moving freely  with the bloodstream) traveling at the vessel wall, was calculated as described (reference 22). DCs were not observed to form productive attachments in E/P-selectin/ mice, where all cells (solid line) traveled at velocities greater than Vcrit, whereas 53% of cells observed in wild-type  mice (dashed line) rolled at velocities less than Vcrit.

Bound antibody (green) was detected using immunofluorescence microscopy. OmpA coated beads with bound antibody appeared yellow when the individual fluorescence channels were merged, whereas beads without bound antibody appeared red. (B to D) OmpA coated beads bind to and are internalized by non-phagocytic RF/6A cells. OmpA coated beads were incubated with RF/6A cells for 1 h after which unbound beads were washed off. Cells were screened with OmpA antibody and examined using immunofluorescence (B and D) or scanning electron microscopy (C) to assess binding or were incubated further to allow for bead uptake. To assess for internalized beads, the host cells were treated with trypsin, washed, incubated overnight for the endothelial cells to re-adhere, fixed, and screened with OmpA antibody and immunofluorescence microscopy. Because the host cells were not permeabilized, bound beads detected by OmpA antibody appeared yellow and internalized beads, which OmpA antibody could not detect, remained red when viewed by immunofluorescence microscopy.

In the vessels lumen, I/R leads to blood clotting, platelet aggregation and cytokine release (IL-1). Translocation of P-selectin on the surface of platelets and EC leads to platelet-leukocyte aggregation. Complement is activated and arachidonic acid metabolites are released. In the vascular wall, upregulation of E- and P-selectin on EC provides a platform for low affinity leukocyte binding through interaction with sialyl Lex moieties of glycoproteins expressed on leukocytes, e.g. <b>PSGL-1</b>. Firm adhesion is obtained after endothelial expression of ICAM-1 interacting with leukocyte 2 integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1)144. Loss of NO promotes vasoconstriction and enhances leukocyte and platelet aggregation. MMP activation could lead to BBB breakdown and matrix proteolysis facilitating leukocyte extravasation. In the perivascular space, chemotactic complement subunits (C5a) acting on mast cell complement receptors (CD88) leads to degranulation and release of histamine and proteases, contributing to BBB leakiness. Cytokines (TNF, IL-1) are produced by mast cells and perivascular macrophages, providing further signals to guide leukocyte migration across the vessel wall145,146. In the brain parenchyma, injured cells release purines (ATP), which act as early proinflammatory signals leading to production of cytokines and chemokines. Disruption of neuronal-microglial interaction (CX3CL1, CD200) and increases in extracellular glutamate (glu) acting on microglial GluR1 metabotropic receptor27 also contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu.

(A)  Scheme for measurement of  the lever arm by reversing  the direction of flow. The lever arm, l, is the distance between the tether point and  the projection of the center  of the neutrophil on the substrate. (B) Estimation of  forces on a neutrophil tethered in shear flow (drawn to  scale). The force balance  equations are Fb cos = Fs  and Fblsin = s + RFs,  where Fb is the force on the  tether bond, Fs is the force on  the cell, and s is the torque  on the cell. The exact solution for Fs for a motionless  hard sphere in shear flow  near a wall is Fs = 6viscosityRhshearC where R is sphere radius, h is the distance from the center of the cell to the wall, and C is a numerical factor determined  by integration that depends on h/R and ranges from 1 to 1.7 (17). With R = 4.25 m for a neutrophil (48), variation of hR from 0 to 0.5  m has little effect on Fs (3%), and we have assumed h = R for a tethered cell. The assumption of hardness is good because no neutrophil deformation is visible microscopically within the range of shear used here. Roughness such as from microvilli is thought to increase Fs only modestly; for a rough object, Fs is intermediate between Fs on a sphere contained in the object and Fs on a sphere containing the object. We estimate uncertainty in R to measurement variation (48) and its effective increase by microvilli as 0.25 m. The  calculated value of Fs and its uncertainty are 59.8  6.9 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. Both the uncertainty in R and in the lever arm  measurement l = 3.06  0.53 m introduce uncertainties into the other calculated values. The uncertainties stemming from R and l  were estimated separately for these values and their variances were added. We calculate  = 62.3  4.2, d = 1.0  0.32 m, Fb/Fs = 2.15   0.32, and Fb = 124.4  26.1 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. (C) Movement of a representative transiently tethered neutrophil on  P-selectin at five sites per m2 during reversal of flow at 0.3 dyn/cm2. The vertical dashed line marks the left boundary of the tethered  cell before flow reversal. (D) Measurement of the lever arm. Each point is a measurement on an individual cell; the lever arm is defined  as half the distance moved during flow reversal while cells were tethered to the indicated density of P-selectin. Shear stress was calibrated from the hydrodynamic velocity of cells in the same chamber using a syringe pump. (E) Velocities after flow reversal of untethered neutrophils and of neutrophils transiently tethered to P-selectin (five sites per m2). The velocity of tethered cells was derived  from a frame by frame analysis of the number of video frames required for a transiently tethered cell to move the distance of 2 l after  flow reversal. Values are the average of two velocity determinations at each wall shear stress. Velocities of cells free in flow (i.e., untethered, traveling at the hydrodynamic velocity) were determined in the same video segments. Velocities of cells free in flow are the mean  of four determinations. Similar velocity determination of cells free in flow was performed on an identical field using a syringe pump generating known wall shear stresses, and the shear stress was calibrated from these velocities. The movement of indicator nontethered  cells in the same field of view was observed to mark flow reversal, and time was not counted until indicator cells reached full velocity  (dead time was about one frame at the lowest shears).

A post-capillary venule in an inflamed brain showing the passage of T cells from the lumen into the CNS parenchyma in a two-step process. Step 1 as a T cell passes from the capillary (T1) to the post-capillary venule, it rolls along the surface of the endothelium (T2) and is arrested by receptors on the T cell and endothelium (T3) (see text for details). The T cell leaves the lumen by diapedesis across the endothelial barrier (T4) and passes through the endothelial basement membrane at sites containing 4 laminin. Areas of basement membrane containing 5 laminin do not allow such diapedesis. The T cell then enters the perivenular space (T5) formed by separation of elements of the glial-endothelial basement membrane (endothelial component: green; glial component: blue). At this point (T5), there is a step of re-activation by recognition of cognate Ag in the perivascular space. As this step also occurs in the absence of neuroinflammation, this holds true for immune surveillance. Infiltrating T cells can recognize their cognate antigen on rare perivascular dendritic cells (DC) and on monocyte-macrophages (M). Step 2 of traffic from blood to CNS involves penetration of the basement membrane of the glia limitans (T6). Recognition of antigen leads to local T-cell activation and upregulation of further trafficking cues on the BBB endothelium allowing for entry of additional immune cells, including bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs, into the perivascular space. This leads to local expression of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 produced by macrophages (M) and to cleaving of extracellular matrix receptors of astrocytic end feet that allow inflammatory cells to enter the CNS parenchyma across the glia limitans (T7)

(Left) In WT mice, L-selectin on a lymphocyte engages a class 1sulfated ligand, which supports rolling and causes L-selectindependent signal transduction. Class 2 L-selectin ligands are expressed but are probably of little relevance in WT mice. Sulfated proteoglycans present CCL21 to its receptor, CCR7, leading to additional activating signals. The integration of L-selectin and CCR7 signals result in increased LFA-1 affinity, which allows binding to ICAM-1, causing lymphocyte arrest. (Right) In HEC-GlcNAc6ST/ mice, class 1 L-selectin ligands are undersulfated and not functional. Class 2 L-selectin ligands, which are overexpressed, engage L-selectin but do not cause L-selectindependent cell and integrin activation. Alternatively, or in addition, proteoglycans may be undersulfated and fail to immobilize CCL21 effectively, preventing or diminishing CCR7-dependent activation. As a result, LFA-1 is not activated and does not engage ICAM-1, and the cell keeps rolling.
