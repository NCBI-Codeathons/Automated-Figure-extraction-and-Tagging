BONDS within the rear row of the CONTACT ZONE experience a bondforce that is calculated by dividing the RearForce, a unitless parameter representing the effects of shear, by the total number of BONDS within the rear row. During a simulation cycle, each MEMBRANE UNIT in the rear row uses the current value of bondforce and the graphed relationship to calculate a probability that each BOND will be broken during that cycle.

(A) The rolling motions of a microsphere or neutrophil of radius r are governed by the balance of the resultant force (Fs) and torque (Ts) exerted by the flowing fluid, the tether force (Ft) applied through L-selectin<b>PSGL-1</b> bonds, and the contact force (Fc). The conversion of wall shear stress to Ft using the indicated variables is described in Materials and methods. Elevating the viscosity by addition of 6% Ficoll increases shear stress by 2.6-fold and therefore increases Ft on a sphere of constant size, as illustrated by the comparative lengths of the thin and thick vectors for Ft on the small sphere. At the same shear stress, Ft is ninefold greater for a sphere of 3-m radius than for a sphere of 1-m radius, as illustrated by the comparative lengths of the thin vectors for Ft on the large and small spheres. (B) A rolling sphere stops when the adhesive bond sustains the full load required to balance the maximum Ft and Ts. After the bond dissociates, the sphere accelerates as it pivots on a newly formed bond upstream and then decelerates as force develops in the bond. The sphere stops again if the new bond has sufficient strength to withstand the full load and lives long enough to survive loading, or it accelerates if the bond dissociates prematurely."

SCARB2 delivers -GC from the ER to the lysosomes under physiological conditions. SCARB2 is abundant in the lysosomal and endosomal compartments, and it also shuttles to the plasma membrane where it encounters EV71. After binding the virus on the cell surface, the virusreceptor complex is internalized via the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. In the endosome or lysosome, where the pH is low, the virus initiates a conformational change that leads to uncoating. <b>PSGL-1</b> can bind EV71 and internalize via caveolin-mediated endocytosis, but <b>PSGL-1</b> cannot initiate uncoating.

(A) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit neutrophils extravasation, chemotaxis and activation. Neutrophil rolling is modulated by staphylococcal superantigen-like 5 (SSL5) that binds <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b>-1 (<b>PSGL-1</b>), blocking its interaction with P-selectin. The adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium and consequent transmigration is inhibited by extracellular adherence protein (Eap), which binds to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). In addition to inhibiting <b>PSGL-1</b>, SSL5 inhibits neutrophil responses to chemokines and to anaphylatoxins, by binding to different chemokine receptors. Several staphylococcal molecules impair neutrophil chemotaxis and important co-signaling events during migration and phagocytosis: chemotaxis-inhibitor protein of S. aureus (CHIPS) binds and inhibits formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and C5a receptor (C5aR); formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitor (FLIPr)-like inhibit FPR1; FLIPr and FLIPr-like inhibit FPR2; staphopain (ScpA) cleaves Chemokine (CXC Motif) Receptor 2 (CXCR2); staphylococcal SSL3 inhibits toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated signaling, the bicomponent leukocidins Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), gamma-hemolysin (Hlg) ABC, leukocidin (Luk) FM, Luk GH/AB, and Luk DE interact with chemoattractant receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Both Hla and Luk GH/AB induce cell lysis by binding ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) and CD11b, respectively. The cytolytic peptides phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) have an amphipathic alpha-helical region that likely contributes to their lytic activity, presumably by membrane insertion and pore formation. (B) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit opsonization and phagocytosis by neutrophils. The secreted metalloprotease aureolysin inhibits phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils by cleaving C3. Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN), SCIN-B, and SCIN-C associate with and inhibits C3 convertase, thereby preventing the production of C3a, C3b, and further C5a and consequently interfering with complement activation. The extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (EFB) and the extracellular complement-binding protein (ECB) also inhibit complement activation by inactivating C5 convertase and staphylococcal SSL7 targets C5. Staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin (SBI) affect both the function of complement and immunoglobulin binding, blocking the classical complement activation pathway, and associates with C3 inhibiting the alternative pathway. Staphylokinase (SAK) forms enzymatically active complexes with C3b blocking complement activation. Staphylococcal SSL10 binds IgG, affecting Fc receptor (FcR) recognition and complement activation."

Platelet adhesion to an injury site at a vessel wall is mediated by the exposure and binding of subendothelial matrix proteins (e.g. collagen, VWF, fibrinogen, and fibronectin) to glycoprotein (GP) receptors on the platelet surface. VWF binding to the GPIb-IX-V complex, collagen binding to platelet GPVI and integrin 21 receptors trigger a signal transduction process resulting in the local release of platelet activation agonists, such as thromboxane A2 and ADP. These agonists along with thrombin produced from coagulation cascades and activated platelets, bind to platelet surface bound G-coupled receptors inducing further platelet activation. Activation of platelet integrin IIb3 induces platelet aggregation mediated by fibrinogen/VWF or the yet undetermined X ligands. Leukocyte-platelet adhesion can be driven by the interaction between platelet surface P-selectin and its counter-receptor <b>PSGL-1</b> situated upon the leukocyte surface. Inhibition of platelet activation is mainly mediated by the PDE/PDE3 regulated degradation and PGI2, NO and GLP-1R regulated activation of cGMP or cAMP.

PMC3792444	/imgs/512/187/3792444/PMC3792444_fimmu-04-00311-g001.png	F1	"Induction of migratory heterogeneity during priming. MR phenotype is impacted by TCR engagement, the level of co-stimulation, and the cytokine milieu (left). MR play a direct role in the formation of the immunological synapse, but TCR signaling subsequently impacts MR expression [panel 1, adapted from Ref. (8)]. Cytoskeletal rearrangements that involve the actin-binding ezrin (ezr), radixin, and moesin (mo) proteins are necessary for TCR signaling complex polarization. The integrin LFA-1 forms a ring surrounding the cSMAC that supports prolonged T cell-DC engagement, while other MR become excluded from the cSMAC. This process is possibly due to differential polarization of ezrin and moesin. Co-stimulatory signaling through molecules also contributes to the migratory heterogeneity of T cells (panel 2). For example, CD28 controls migration through upregulation of OX40, which is instrumental for CXCR5 expression and T cell localization to germinal centers (GC). In addition CD28/TCR signaling activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, which inhibits Foxo1 leading to decreased KLF2 expression. Differential co-stimulation can impact the levels of CD62L, CCR7, and S1P1 and thereby regulate the egress of T cells into the circulation. Cytokines released by DC promote specific transcriptional profiles that introduce further MR heterogeneity (panel 3). DC-derived IL-12 induces expression of the transcription factor T-bet and determines a CD4+ Th1 or CD8+ effector transcriptional program that results in part in the expression of CXCR3 and <b>PSGL-1</b>, which contribute to homing to peripheral sites. Alternatively, induction of the Tfh-associated transcription factor Bcl6 by IL-6 and IL-21 results in the downregulation of <b>PSGL-1</b> and increased expression of CXCR5, which allows these cells to migrate from the T cell zones in the paracortex into GC."

T cells that are primed in gut-associated lymphoid tissues preferentially express functional <b>PSGL-1</b>, 47, and CCR9, which support migration through the post capillary venules of the small intestine to enter the lamina propria and intraepithelial compartment (panel 1). CD103-expressing DC impart the intestinal homing signature on T cells during priming by expression of retinoic acid (RA) in response to microbiota-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. A different program of MR usage is induced during priming of nave T cells in skin-draining LN (panel 2). T cells in the skin express the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), an inducible carbohydrate modification of <b>PSGL-1</b>, CCR4, CCR8, CCR10, 41, and LFA-1, which mitigates their migration into the skin. Analogous to intestinal imprinting, CCR10, but not CCR4, expression is regulated by skin-draining DCs that synthesize the vitamin D3 metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses 47 and CCR9 expression and RA inhibits CCR4 and CCR10 expression. In addition, CCR8 expression is imprinted by epidermal keratinocytes, although the skin-specific factors that induce CCR8 remain unknown. Evidence for imprinting of T cells in the lung is limited, but recent evidence suggests that lung DC-activated T cell migrate more efficiently into the lung, which was attributed to CCR4, although other MR are likely to contribute (panel 3). Many lymphocytes in the lung express high levels of 41, 11, and LFA-1 and CD8+ T cells primed in the mediastinal LN are enriched for CCR5 and CXCR3 expression, suggesting a pulmonary profile driven by distinct molecular mechanisms."

Inflammatory monocytes are characterized by higher expression levels in <b>PSGL-1</b>, CCR1 and CCR2. Therefore these molecules were proposed to be essential for recruitment of this monocyte subset. In contrast, CCR5 and CX3CR1 seem to be of major importance for extravasation of resident monocytes. Inflammatory monocytes will differentiate to macrophages, which take up oxLDL forming foam cells. These cells are critically involved in atheroprogression by releasing cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-6), chemokines (e.g. MCP-1), proteases (e.g. MMPs), and lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes). Resident monocytes on the other hand may acquire DC-markers such as CD11c. Hyperlipidaemia skews monocyte counts and function in several ways (in red). Monocytosis of inflammatory monocytes may be due to reduced conversion to resident monocytes or enhanced mobilisation from the bone marrow, some of which may be due to higher levels of circulating MCP-1. Furthermore, CCR2, <b>PSGL-1</b>, and CD11b on inflammatory monocytes is enhanced by hyperlipidaemia. The emigrated monocyte will retain in the vessel wall due to decrease of CCR2 and increase in CX3CR1."

Subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the plasma involved in coagulation are thought to have three origins: monocyte-derived EVs (blue), platelet-derived EVs (red) and endothelial cell-derived EVs (green) as outlined in the enlarged EV 3-colour pie chart. EVs contain proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis. For coagulation TF is the key initiator of the coagulation cascade and forms a complex with factor VIIa (FVIIa).

The L-selectinexpressing lymphocyte translates close to the ligand with hydrodynamic velocity dictated by the shear rate. At a low subthreshold shear rate, the initial L-selectinligand bond (top left) dissociates within a few ms before a second bond (e.g., on a neighboring microvillus) can form downstream of the first bond. At high threshold shear rate (top middle), the leukocyte held by the first bond may rotate rapidly enough to encounter a second ligand site (top middle) and to form a multivalent tether. This initial stabilization is conditional for a second, cytoplasmic tailmediated stabilization event (anchorage) to take place and further prolong tether lifetime, possibly via local rebinding (depicted as ). As force is loaded, the trailing microvillus extends and the cell detaches (top right). In contrast, the high affinity P-selectin<b>PSGL-1</b> bond (bottom left) lasts two orders of magnitude longer than the L-selectincarbohydrate bond, and undergoes local rebinding favored by selectin and ligand dimerization within the first occupied microvillus, often without a need for a secondary contact (bottom left).

These glycans can target multiple points during the inflammatory process. (A) In response to an inflammatory stimuli, such as a bacterial infection, resident macrophages in inner tissues produce both chemokines that attract more leukocytes into these inflamed tissues, and cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor, TNF) that trigger, at the early stages, the display of pre-formed P-selectins on the luminal surface of endothelial cells (the cytokine-induced P-selectin exposure is not shown at the panels). Cytokines can also induce the expression of E-selectin by endothelial cells (mechanism not shown). GAGs at endothelial proteoglycans play an important role in L-selectin binding, in chemokine presentation to chemokine receptors on neutrophils, and in the transportation of chemokines produced by tissue macrophages and further infiltrated leukocytes. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), and <b>P-selectin glycoprotein ligand</b>-1 (PSGL) are important leukocyte cell-membrane proteins involved in rolling and firm adhesion, respectively. (B) In the presence of SFs, and likely SGs, by direct contact, both P- and L-selectins are blocked to interact further with <b>PSGL-1</b>, and GAGs, respectively, thus, causing a reduction on the leukocyte recruitment. In addition, at certain concentrations, SFs and SGs sequestrate the chemokines responsible to drive and to activate the leukocytes. This is another anti-inflammatory action of these marine glycans. This sequestration occurs most likely because of the presence of conserved heparin-binding sites (BBXB motifs, where B and X are basic and neutral amino acids) in some pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES. Due to chemokine sequestration, the numbers of activated defense cells, their firm attachment to the endothelial surface and further infiltration become all consequently reduced in treatment cases. Besides those actions, the number of released chemokine as a pro-inflammatory feedback process from inner tissues is also attenuated due to the decreased number of infiltrated cells. This latter event enhances the anti-inflammatory activity of the MSPs. All mechanisms marked by X in (B) collaborate in conjunction to the resultant anti-inflammatory action of SFs and SGs.

Tether duration points that fit a first-order dissociation curve (open and filled triangles) were connected by straight lines, with slopes equal to koff. At all densities, L-selectin tethers fit a straight line with a fast koff, k1. More than 98% of tethers formed on 10 ng/ml PNAd dissociated with this k1.

Moreover, CXCL4 decreases HIV infection but also enhances liver fibrosis. CCL5, another -granule-derived chemokine, also decreases HIV infection and enhances Th1 lymphocyte responses in HCV infection and serves as a survival signal for macrophages in influenza infection. Platelets release PMPs and -defensins from their -granules, which mediate virus neutralization. They protect splenocytes from necrosis in LCMV infection. Platelet dense granules contain 5-HT, which enables liver regeneration but also HBV and HCV infection. Platelet activation leads to the expression and release of CD154 and CD62P, which allow direct interaction between platelets and leukocytes. Platelet interaction with B-lymphocytes enhances germinal center formation and antiviral IgG production. Platelets trigger T-lymphocyte differentiation and cytotoxicity as well as survival and differentiation of monocytes. In neutrophils, platelet adhesion stimulates ROS production and boosts phagocytosis. Platelet interaction with dendritic cells promotes their maturation and facilitates antigen presentation.

Peripherally, nave T cells (N) encounter APC that present peptides from aberrant, misfolded, or aggregated proteins associated with neuroinflammatory processes. Upon presentation of antigen and delivery of appropriate co-stimulatory signals by APC, nave T cells recognizing the antigen/MHC complex via the TCR become activated (A) leading to upregulation of CAMs on the T cell surface. These receptors and ligands include, but are not limited to, integrins, MCAM, and <b>PSGL-1</b>. Similarly, at sites of neuronal injury and neuroinflammation, danger signals, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines induce upregulation of endothelial associated CAMs on the basolateral side of the blood brain barrier. Following upregulation of CAMs, activated T cells (such as pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or regulatory T cells) enter the vasculature and begin the process of extravasation via either a trans- or para-cellular route. This migratory process occurs in a step-wise manner beginning with T cells loosely tethering to endothelial cells via the binding of T cell ligands to selectins, such as E-selectin and other CAMs, such as VCAM, ICAM, and laminin 411 on the luminal side of the endothelial cells. Loose tethering allows the cell to roll along the luminal side of the endothelium and interact with CAMs, pulling it closer to the endothelial cell layer to eventual capture. Upon clustering of receptors and ligands on T cell and endothelial cell surfaces, the T cell begins &quot;crawling&quot; across the endothelial surface until reaching an endothelial cell junction, which signals the initiation of extravasation. Transmigration proceeds, via a chemotactic gradient allowing antigen-specific T cells entrance to the brain. Once in the parenchyma, activated T cells recognize antigen presented by MHC, initiating the efferent response program of the T cells to deliver either effector or regulatory function that supports the respective neurodegenerative or neuroprotective outcome."

Under such conditions, aged vessels have a compromised vasodilation, inducing endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired tissue perfusion. Moreover, the atherosclerosis process is accompanied by a low-grade inflammation, which could be favored by endothelial dysfunction. The recruitment of leukocytes into areas of inflammation is mediated by interacting sets of cell adhesion molecules (showed step by step in order of activation). T-cells and monocytes are the first cells infiltrating the arterial intima, and represent a hallmark of endothelial damage favoring the early stages of atherogenesis. In atherosclerosis, focal expression of key adhesion molecules, mainly triggered by plasma atherogenic lipoproteins, may also mediate the recruitment of mononuclear cells to the plaque. Among these adhesion molecules, ICAM-1, a protein of the Ig superfamily, and one of the ligands for LFA-1, has been suggested to play an important role in atherogenesis. Thus, the increased ICAM-1 expression detected in this study could be associated with an enhanced recruitment of monocytes and T lymphocytes. Finally, in advanced stages, immune cells function also decline, contributing to inflammation and vascular damage and triggering CVD risk. (Modified from Gonzlez-Amaro R. [51]).

(Phase I) Neutrophils (N) interact with circulating platelets (PLT): after recognition of platelet P-selectin by the P-selectin granulocyte ligand 1 (<b>PSGL1</b>), neutrophils implement their engagement with platelets by upregulating Mac-1 (also known as M2 or CD11b/CD18), a surface integrin that interacts with platelet-bound fibrinogen in cooperation with glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa (also known as 2b3 integrin). The activation of neutrophils (possibly further enhanced by CD40CD40 ligand (CD40L) interactions) results in the release of enzymatic moieties such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), proteinase 3 (PR3) and of the prestored soluble pattern recognition receptor pentraxin (PTX)3 as well as in the expression of tissue factor (TF), which in turn promotes thrombin generation. Platelets also release various bioactive signals such as leukotrienes (LTs), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF), lysosphingolipids (LPs), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT). (Phase II) Recognition of phosphatidylserine (P-Ser) on platelets prompts their phagocytic clearance and quenches their procoagulant capacity; neutrophil ADPases break the auto/paracrine loop of ADP-mediated platelet activation. Neutrophils that had phagocytosed platelets become largely anergic after degranulation."

(B) CD4 is the primary receptor for HIVs, but virus penetration requires further interactions with chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. Initial observations indicated that coreceptor engagement triggered fusion directly at the plasma membrane; however, recent studies suggest that fusion can also occur after endocytosis (Miyauchi et al., 2009). Although these mechanisms appear mutually exclusive, it is possible that both may operate, and additional studies are required to establish the relevant pathway for key target cells in vivo.

The TEV-FLAG site is positioned 39 amino acids N-terminally of the assumed start of the transmembrane domain (TMD). Shedding yields sAPLP2TF, which was immunoprecipitated and digested with TEV-protease, leading to a small peptide harboring the N-terminal FLAG-tag as well as the C-terminal cleavage site resulting from the shedding. This peptide was analyzed in a mass spectrometer. (B) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the APLP2TF construct and either treated with TAPI-1 (50 M) or DMSO as a solvent control. Upon TAPI-1 treatment secreted sAPLP2TF levels were clearly decreased in the conditioned medium of the cells. An accumulation of APLP2TF levels was observed upon TAPI-1 treatment in the cell lysate.

Mast cells release both histamine and S1P that can both mobilize P-selectin independently through the H1 and S1P3 receptor, respectively. However, histamine achieves full scale P-selectin mobilization by additional Gq-dependent activation of Sphk1, S1P production/release and subsequent activation of S1P3. Other P-selectin mobilizing agents such as epinephrine that require cAMP for P-selectin mobilization also employ Sphk1 for full-blown effect but do so through a Gs/AC/cAMP-dependent pathway. S1P1 plays an inhibitory effect on P-selectin-dependent rolling by reducing AC-induced Sphk1 activity through Gi. DOP and pFTY720 act in an inhibitory manner on rolling by downregulating S1P1 and S1P3, but in addition, pFTY720 directly inhibits the Gq-dependent part of S1P-incuded S1P3-dependent P-selectin mobilization. In summary, the pro-rolling effect of S1P3 dominates over the anti-rolling of S1P1, and the net effect of acute S1P exposure is an overall increase in P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling.

When the thymic niche is occupied (left), a signal generated by ETPs or niche cells inhibits P-selectin and CCL25 expression by the endothelium. Over a period of 2 wk, some ETP niches become vacant, relieving the inhibitory signal and leading to increased P-selectin and CCL25 expression (right). TPCs are then able to home into the thymus and give rise to ETPs, restarting the clock. Alternatively, when a niche is empty, niche cells may release a factor that promotes endothelial P-selectin and CCL25 expression and is consumed by ETPs."

C) Inflammatory mediators provoke the release of proteases (MMPs) by granulocytes or stem cells within the bone marrow, which cleave the molecular anchors of stem cells and increase their release in the circulation."

These monocytes differentiate into macrophages. (B) Macrophages uptake oxLDL sequestered in the subendothelium eventually becoming lipid-laden foam cells. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can migrate to the subendothelium where they lose expression of SMC markers and gain expression of macrophage markers. This allows them to ingest lipids and eventually become foam cells contributing to plaque progression. (C) These foam cells eventually undergo apoptosis and necroptosis, and, if not effectively cleared by M2 macrophages via efferocytosis, undergo secondary necrosis contributing to the formation of the necrotic core. As the necrotic core grows and the fibrous cap thins, the plaque is vulnerable to rupture, which may result in acute cardiovascular events such as thrombosis. (D) VSMCs near the cap of the plaque secrete extracellular matrix components that contribute to the formation of a fibrous cap that protects the plaque from rupturing.

A, single letter amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Black letters define the polybasic, membrane proximal domain. The box and ovals depict amino acid residues that have been previously shown to contribute to binding CaM and ERM, respectively (see Refs. 5, 6, 9 for more detail). Underlined region of the L-selectin tail marks the epitope recognized by the CA21 monoclonal antibody. B, Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel showing the relative binding of moesin FERM or CaM to the L-selectin beads, which were pre-saturated with (lanes 1-5) or without (lanes 6-9) CaM. 5 g/ml of CaM was used to preload the beads prior to incubation with increasing amounts of moesin FERM domain. Coomassie-stained gels are representative of three independent experiments. C, binding of moesin FERM domain and CaM to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin is calcium-independent. The L-selectin beads were preloaded with either moesin FERM (lanes 1 and 2) or CaM (lanes 3 and 4). Preloaded beads were then incubated with CaM and moesin FERM, respectively. Binding reaction was supplemented either with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) 5 mm EGTA. Bound proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel is representative of three independent experiments. D, biotin transfer of SBED from the L-selectin tail to either moesin FERM domain or CaM is equal and independent of pre-mixing (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Materials and Methods for more information of SBED biotin transfer procedure). In brief, 3.6 m SBED-conjugated L-selectin tail was mixed with 4.6 m CaM and/or moesin FERM at room temperature for 30 min. In mixing experiments, a 30-min gap was left between adding proteins, which was deemed ample time for the first protein to bind to the L-selectin tail. The left-hand top and bottom panels represent PVDF transfer membranes developed with 1 g/ml streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The right-hand top and bottom panels represent the same PVDF membranes from the left-hand panels, which were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue to show relative abundance of CaM and moesin FERM used in the experiment (loading control), and is representative of three independent experiments. E, equal concentrations of CaM (4.6 m) or moesin FERM (4.6 m) were mixed individually or together with increasing amounts of soluble L-selectin tail peptide (i.e. 0, 1.72, 3.44, 6.88, 13.75, 27.50, 55, 110, and 220 m). Protein products were cross-linked with DSS, resolved on polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to a PVDF membrane for Western blotting with CA21 monoclonal anti-L-selectin tail antibody. Shifts in molecular masses of the L-selectin tail corresponded to the molecular mass of CaM (18 kDa), moesin FERM (30 kDa), or a mixture of the two (50 kDa). The arrow to the right of the molecular weight markers denotes the higher molecular weight complexes that likely correspond to a 1:1:1 stoichiometry between the tail of L-selectin, CaM, and moesin FERM.

(C+D) Mass spectrometry-based identification of the -secretase cleavage sites. Under control conditions, seven peaks were detected with a maximal total ion count of 497. Upon Merck A treatment, the intensity (ion count) for the peaks was reduced significantly. Peaks are labeled with identifiers #1#7 linking them to the respective peptides sequences in the table (D). All peptides were detected with a mass error of less than 0.3 Da. (E) Determination of the labeling efficiency for the SILAC experiment. To determine the labeling efficiency, proteins from the cell lysates of the heavy labeled cells from (F) were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. One band was cut out and tryptic in gel digestion was performed. Peptides resulting from this digestion were analyzed in an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified by database search, and the labeling efficiency (Label. Eff.) was determined from the heavy to light ratios (Heavy/Light) of the quantifiable peptides. Further, coverage of the proteins in % (Coverage), number of unique peptides identified (Peptides), molecular weight of respective protein (MW), SEQUEST score (Score) and number of unique peptides used for quantification (H/L Count) are given. (F) Analysis of -secretase-dependent CTF cleavage by quantitative mass spectrometry. Upper panel: Cells without Merck A (Control) grown either in light or in heavy medium. Supernatants were combined, peptides immunoprecipitated and analyzed in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Peaks resulting from the light and the heavy labeled peptides are clearly separated (+10 Da as expected for one heavy labeled arginine). Intensities of corresponding heavy and light peak clusters are not identical, as the heavy clusters are either shifted (+10 Da) or supershifted (+16 Da) due to additional incorporation of a heavy proline resulting from arginine- to-proline conversion. Lower panel: upon treatment of the light labeled cells with Merck A and the heavy labeled cells with DMSO as a solvent control, the ratio between the intensity of the light labeled peptides and the heavy labeled peptides is significantly reduced if compared to the control experiment. This demonstrates that the identified peptide peaks are generated by -secretase. (G) Comparison of the position of the - and -secretase cleavage sites of APP and APLP2 in an alignment of the juxtamembrane and the transmembrane region of these two proteins. The dark boxes mark the predicted transmembrane domains (TMD), while the light box indicates amino acids which could potentially still be part of the transmembrane domain, as they do not harbor charges."

In the vessels lumen, I/R leads to blood clotting, platelet aggregation and cytokine release (IL-1). Translocation of P-selectin on the surface of platelets and EC leads to platelet-leukocyte aggregation. Complement is activated and arachidonic acid metabolites are released. In the vascular wall, upregulation of E- and P-selectin on EC provides a platform for low affinity leukocyte binding through interaction with sialyl Lex moieties of glycoproteins expressed on leukocytes, e.g. <b>PSGL-1</b>. Firm adhesion is obtained after endothelial expression of ICAM-1 interacting with leukocyte 2 integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1)144. Loss of NO promotes vasoconstriction and enhances leukocyte and platelet aggregation. MMP activation could lead to BBB breakdown and matrix proteolysis facilitating leukocyte extravasation. In the perivascular space, chemotactic complement subunits (C5a) acting on mast cell complement receptors (CD88) leads to degranulation and release of histamine and proteases, contributing to BBB leakiness. Cytokines (TNF, IL-1) are produced by mast cells and perivascular macrophages, providing further signals to guide leukocyte migration across the vessel wall145,146. In the brain parenchyma, injured cells release purines (ATP), which act as early proinflammatory signals leading to production of cytokines and chemokines. Disruption of neuronal-microglial interaction (CX3CL1, CD200) and increases in extracellular glutamate (glu) acting on microglial GluR1 metabotropic receptor27 also contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu."

PMC2136756	/imgs/512/228/2136756/PMC2136756_JCB.12320f8c.png	F8	"The lever arm acting on a transient tether, the  dimension of the adhesive  contact zone, and the force  on the tether bond. (A)  Scheme for measurement of  the lever arm by reversing  the direction of flow. The lever arm, l, is the distance between the tether point and  the projection of the center  of the neutrophil on the substrate. (B) Estimation of  forces on a neutrophil tethered in shear flow (drawn to  scale). The force balance  equations are Fb cos = Fs  and Fblsin = s + RFs,  where Fb is the force on the  tether bond, Fs is the force on  the cell, and s is the torque  on the cell. The exact solution for Fs for a motionless  hard sphere in shear flow  near a wall is Fs = 6viscosityRhshearC where R is sphere radius, h is the distance from the center of the cell to the wall, and C is a numerical factor determined  by integration that depends on h/R and ranges from 1 to 1.7 (17). With R = 4.25 m for a neutrophil (48), variation of hR from 0 to 0.5  m has little effect on Fs (3%), and we have assumed h = R for a tethered cell. The assumption of hardness is good because no neutrophil deformation is visible microscopically within the range of shear used here. Roughness such as from microvilli is thought to increase Fs only modestly; for a rough object, Fs is intermediate between Fs on a sphere contained in the object and Fs on a sphere containing the object. We estimate uncertainty in R to measurement variation (48) and its effective increase by microvilli as 0.25 m. The  calculated value of Fs and its uncertainty are 59.8  6.9 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. Both the uncertainty in R and in the lever arm  measurement l = 3.06  0.53 m introduce uncertainties into the other calculated values. The uncertainties stemming from R and l  were estimated separately for these values and their variances were added. We calculate  = 62.3  4.2, d = 1.0  0.32 m, Fb/Fs = 2.15   0.32, and Fb = 124.4  26.1 pN per dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. (C) Movement of a representative transiently tethered neutrophil on  P-selectin at five sites per m2 during reversal of flow at 0.3 dyn/cm2. The vertical dashed line marks the left boundary of the tethered  cell before flow reversal. (D) Measurement of the lever arm. Each point is a measurement on an individual cell; the lever arm is defined  as half the distance moved during flow reversal while cells were tethered to the indicated density of P-selectin. Shear stress was calibrated from the hydrodynamic velocity of cells in the same chamber using a syringe pump. (E) Velocities after flow reversal of untethered neutrophils and of neutrophils transiently tethered to P-selectin (five sites per m2). The velocity of tethered cells was derived  from a frame by frame analysis of the number of video frames required for a transiently tethered cell to move the distance of 2 l after  flow reversal. Values are the average of two velocity determinations at each wall shear stress. Velocities of cells free in flow (i.e., untethered, traveling at the hydrodynamic velocity) were determined in the same video segments. Velocities of cells free in flow are the mean  of four determinations. Similar velocity determination of cells free in flow was performed on an identical field using a syringe pump generating known wall shear stresses, and the shear stress was calibrated from these velocities. The movement of indicator nontethered  cells in the same field of view was observed to mark flow reversal, and time was not counted until indicator cells reached full velocity  (dead time was about one frame at the lowest shears)."

A post-capillary venule in an inflamed brain showing the passage of T cells from the lumen into the CNS parenchyma in a two-step process. Step 1 as a T cell passes from the capillary (T1) to the post-capillary venule, it rolls along the surface of the endothelium (T2) and is arrested by receptors on the T cell and endothelium (T3) (see text for details). The T cell leaves the lumen by diapedesis across the endothelial barrier (T4) and passes through the endothelial basement membrane at sites containing 4 laminin. Areas of basement membrane containing 5 laminin do not allow such diapedesis. The T cell then enters the perivenular space (T5) formed by separation of elements of the glial-endothelial basement membrane (endothelial component: green; glial component: blue). At this point (T5), there is a step of re-activation by recognition of cognate Ag in the perivascular space. As this step also occurs in the absence of neuroinflammation, this holds true for immune surveillance. Infiltrating T cells can recognize their cognate antigen on rare perivascular dendritic cells (DC) and on monocyte-macrophages (M). Step 2 of traffic from blood to CNS involves penetration of the basement membrane of the glia limitans (T6). Recognition of antigen leads to local T-cell activation and upregulation of further trafficking cues on the BBB endothelium allowing for entry of additional immune cells, including bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs, into the perivascular space. This leads to local expression of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 produced by macrophages (M) and to cleaving of extracellular matrix receptors of astrocytic end feet that allow inflammatory cells to enter the CNS parenchyma across the glia limitans (T7)"

(Left) In WT mice, L-selectin on a lymphocyte engages a class 1sulfated ligand, which supports rolling and causes L-selectindependent signal transduction. Class 2 L-selectin ligands are expressed but are probably of little relevance in WT mice. Sulfated proteoglycans present CCL21 to its receptor, CCR7, leading to additional activating signals. The integration of L-selectin and CCR7 signals result in increased LFA-1 affinity, which allows binding to ICAM-1, causing lymphocyte arrest. (Right) In HEC-GlcNAc6ST/ mice, class 1 L-selectin ligands are undersulfated and not functional. Class 2 L-selectin ligands, which are overexpressed, engage L-selectin but do not cause L-selectindependent cell and integrin activation. Alternatively, or in addition, proteoglycans may be undersulfated and fail to immobilize CCL21 effectively, preventing or diminishing CCR7-dependent activation. As a result, LFA-1 is not activated and does not engage ICAM-1, and the cell keeps rolling."

Glycosidase- and mock-treated cells were incubated with 1,3/6-fucose-specific lectin, AAL; the 2,3-sialic acid-specific lectin, MAL II; His-OmpA; or His-Asp14. (A) The host cells were fixed and screened using immmunofluorescence microscopy (A and B) or flow cytometry (C and D) to detect lectin, His-OmpA, or His-Asp14 binding to host cells. In A and B, green fluorescence corresponds to lectin (AAL or MAL II) or His-tagged protein (OmpA or Aps14) bound at cell surfaces. Host cell nuclei are stained blue by DAPI. (E) AAL and MAL II competitively inhibit His-OmpA binding to mammalian host cells. RF/6A cells were incubated with AAL and MAL II, after which His-OmpA was added. Following the removal of unbound recombinant protein, His-OmpA bound on RF/6A cell surfaces was detected by flow cytometry. Statistically significant (***P &lt; 0.001) values are indicated. Results shown are representative of three experiments with similar results."
